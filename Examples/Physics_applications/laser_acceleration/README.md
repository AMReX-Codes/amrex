# Examples of laser acceleration simulations.

Examples are provided using the executable or Python-driven version of WarpX.

## Using the executable version:
  - inputs.2d:       2d simulation of LWFA in the laboratory frame.
  - inputs.3d:       3d simulation of LWFA in the laboratory frame.
  - inputs.2d.boost: 2d simulation of LWFA in a boosted frame. This script also
    uses rigid injection and a parser for the plasma density.

## Using the python-driven version:
  - laser_acceleration_PICMI.py
