Python Interface
================


The core of AMReX is written in C++.
For users who want to write all of their programs in Python, or C++ application developers that like to add Python interfaces to their applications for scripting, rapid prototyping, code coupling and/or AI/ML workflows, many AMReX classes, functions and all data containers are now also available.

Please see `pyAMReX <https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/pyamrex/>`__ (`manual <https://pyamrex.readthedocs.io>`__) for further details.
