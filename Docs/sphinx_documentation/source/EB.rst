Overview of Embedded Boundary Description
=========================================

For computations with complex geometries, AMReX provides data structures and
algorithms to employ an embedded boundary (EB) approach to PDE discretizations.
In this approach, the underlying computational mesh is uniform and
block-structured, but the boundary of the irregular-shaped computational domain
conceptually cuts through this mesh. Each cell in the mesh becomes labeled as
regular, cut or covered, and the finite-volume based discretization methods
traditionally used in AMReX applications can be modified to incorporate these
cell shapes. See :numref:`fig::ebexample` for an illustration.

   : In the embedded boundary approach to discretizing PDEs, the (uniform)
   rectangular mesh is cut by the irregular shape of the computational domain.
   The cells in the mesh are label as regular, cut or covered.

.. raw:: latex

   \end{center}

Because this is a relatively simple grid generation technique, computational
meshes for rather complex geometries can be generated quickly and robustly.
However, the technique can produce arbitrarily small cut cells in the domain.
In practice such small cells can have significant impact on the robustness and
stability of traditional finite volume methods. In this chapter we overview a
class of approaches to deal with this "small cell" problem in a robust and
efficient way, and discuss the tools and data that AMReX provides in order to
implement them.

Note that in a completely general implementation of the EB approach, there
would be no restrictions on the shape or complexity of the EB surface.  With
this generality comes the possibility that the process of "cutting" the cells
results in a single :math:`(i,j,k)` cell being broken into multiple cell
fragments.  The current release of AMReX does not support multi-valued cells,
thus there is a practical restriction on the complexity of domains (and
numerical algorithms) supported.

This chapter discusses the EB tools, data structures and algorithms currently
supported by AMReX to enable the construction of discretizations of
conservation law systems. The discussion will focus on general requirements
associated with building fluxes and taking divergences of them to advance such
systems. We also give examples of how to initialize the geometry data
structures and access them to build the numerical difference
operators.  Finally we present EB support of linear solvers.

Finite Volume Discretizations
-----------------------------

Consider a system of PDEs to advance a conserved quantity :math:`U` with fluxes
:math:`F`:

.. math:: \frac{\partial U}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot F = 0.
  :label: eqn::hypsys

A conservative, finite volume discretization starts with the divergence theorm

.. math:: \int_V \nabla \cdot F dV = \int_{\partial V} F \cdot n dA.

In an embedded boundary cell, the "conservative divergence" is discretized (as
:math:`D^c(F)`) as follows

.. math::
  :label: eqn::ebdiv

   D^c(F) = \frac{1}{\kappa h} \left( \sum^D_{d = 1}
     (F_{d, \mathrm{hi}} \, \alpha_{d, \mathrm{hi}} - F_{d, \mathrm{lo}}\, \alpha_{d, \mathrm{lo}})
     + F^{EB} \alpha^{EB} \right).

Geometry is discretely represented by volumes (:math:`V = \kappa h^d`) and
apertures (:math:`A= \alpha h^{d-1}`), where :math:`h` is the (uniform) mesh
spacing at that AMR level, :math:`\kappa` is the volume fraction and
:math:`\alpha` are the area fractions. Without multivalued cells the volume
fractions, area fractions and cell and face centroids (see
:numref:`fig::volume`) are the only geometric information needed to compute
second-order fluxes centered at the face centroids, and to infer the
connectivity of the cells. Cells are connected if adjacent on the Cartesian
mesh, and only via coordinate-aligned faces on the mesh. If an aperture,
:math:`\alpha = 0`, between two cells, they are not directly connected to each
other.

Small Cells And Stability
-------------------------

In the context of time-explicit advance methods for, say hyperbolic
conservation laws, a naive discretization in time of :eq:`eqn::hypsys` using
:eq:`eqn::ebdiv`,

.. math:: U^{n+1} = U^{n} - \delta t D^c(F)

would have a time step constraint :math:`\delta t \sim h \kappa^{1/D}/V_m`,
which goes to zero as the size of the smallest volume fraction :math:`\kappa` in
the calculation. Since EB volume fractions can be arbitrarily small, this is an
unacceptable constraint. One way to remedy this is to create "non-conservative"
approximation to the divergence :math:`D^{nc}`, which at a cell :math:`{\bf i}`,
can be formed as an average of the conservative divergences in the neighborhood,
:math:`N_{\bf i}`, of :math:`{\bf i}`.

.. math:: D^{nc}(F)_{\bf i}= \frac{\sum_{{\bf j}\in N_{\bf i}}\kappa_{\bf j}D(F)_{\bf j}}{\sum_{{\bf j}\in N_{\bf i}}\kappa_{\bf j}}

Incorporating this form, the solution can be updated using a *hybrid
divergence*, :math:`D^H(F) = \kappa D^c(F) + (1-\kappa)D^{nc}`:

.. math:: U^{n+1,*} = U^n - \delta t D^H(F)

However, we would like our finite-volume scheme to strictly conserve the field
quantities over the domain. To enforce this, we calculate :math:`\delta M`, the
mass gained or lost by not using :math:`D^c` directly,

.. math:: \delta M_{\bf i}= \kappa (1-\kappa)(D^c(F)_{\bf i}- D^{nc}(F)_{\bf i})

This "excess material" (mass, if :math:`U=\rho`) can be *redistributed* in a
time-explicit fashion to neighboring cells, :math:`{\bf j}\in N_{\bf i}`:

.. math:: \delta M_{\bf i}= \sum_{{\bf j}\in N_{\bf i}} \delta M_{{\bf j}, {\bf i}}.

in order to preserve strict conservation over :math:`N_{\bf i}`.

Note that the physics at hand may impact the optimal choice of precisely how the
excess mass is distributed in this fashion. We introduce a weighting for
redistribution, :math:`W`,

.. math::
  :label: eqn::massweight

   \delta M_{{\bf j}, {\bf i}} =  \frac{\delta M_{\bf i}\kappa_{\bf j}
     W_{\bf j}}{\sum_{{\bf k}\in N_{\bf i}} \kappa_{\bf k}W_{\bf k}}

For all :math:`{\bf j}\in N_{\bf i}`,

.. math::

   U^{n+1}_{\bf j}= U^{n+1,*}_{\bf j}+
    \frac{\delta M_{\bf i}
     W_{\bf j}}{\sum_{{\bf k}\in N_{\bf i}} \kappa_{\bf k}W_{\bf k}}.

Typically, the redistribution neighborhood for each cell is one that can be
reached via a monotonic path in each coordinate direction of unit length (see,
e.g., :numref:`fig::redistribution`)

.. raw:: latex

   \begin{center}

.. _fig::redistribution:

.. figure:: ./EB/redist.png
   :width: 50.0%

   : Redistribution illustration. Excess mass due to using a hybrid divergence
   :math:`D^H` instead of the conservative divergence :math:`D^C` is
   distributed to neighbor cells.

Initializing the Geometric Database
===================================

In AMReX geometric information is stored in a distributed database
class that must be initialized at the start of the calculation. The
procedure for this goes as follows:

- Define an implicit function of position which describes the surface of the
  embedded object. Specifically, the function class must have a public member
  function that takes a position and returns a negative value if that position
  is inside the fluid, a positive value in the body, and identically zero at the
  embedded boundary.

.. highlight:: c++

::

   Real operator() (const Array<Real,AMREX_SPACEDIM>& p) const;

- Make a :cpp:`EB2::GeometryShop` object using the implicit function. 

- Build an :cpp:`EB2::IndexSpace` with the :cpp:`EB2::GeometryShop` object and a
  :cpp:`Geometry` object that contains the information about the domain and the
  mesh.

Here is a simple example of initialize the database for an embedded sphere.

.. highlight:: c++

::

    Real radius = 0.5;
    Array<Real,AMREX_SPACEDIM> center{0., 0., 0.}; //Center of the sphere
    bool inside = false;  // Is the fluid inside the sphere?
    EB2::SphereIF sphere(radius, center, inside);

    auto shop = EB2::makeShop(sphere);

    Geometry geom(...);
    EB2::Build(shop, geom, 0, 0);

.. _sec:EB:ebinit:IF:

Implicit Function
-----------------

In ``amrex/Src/EB/``, there are a number of predefined implicit function classes
for basic shapes. One can use these directly or as template for their own
classes.

- :cpp:`AllRegularIF`:  No embedded boundaries at all.

- :cpp:`BoxIF`: Box.

- :cpp:`CylinderIF`: Cylinder.

- :cpp:`EllipsoidIF`: Ellipsoid.

- :cpp:`PlaneIF`: Half-space plane.

- :cpp:`SphereIF`: Sphere.

AMReX also provides a number of transformation operations to apply to an object.

- :cpp:`makeComplement`: Complement of an object. E.g. a sphere with fluid on
  outside becomes a sphere with fluid inside.

- :cpp:`makeIntersection`: Intersection of two or more objects.

- :cpp:`makeUnion`: Union of two or more objects.

- :cpp:`Translate`: Translates an object.

- :cpp:`scale`: Scales an object.

- :cpp:`rotate`: Rotates an object.

- :cpp:`lathe`: Creates a surface of revolution by rotating a 2D object around an axis.

Here are some examples of using these functions.

.. highlight: c++

::

    EB2::SphereIF sphere1(...);
    EB2::SphereIF sphere2(...);
    EB2::BoxIF box(...);
    EB2::CylinderIF cylinder(...);
    EB2::PlaneIF plane(...);

    // union of two spheres
    auto twospheres = EB2::makeUnion(sphere1, sphere2);

    // intersection of a rotated box, a plane and the union of two spheres
    auto box_plane = EB2::makeIntersection(amrex::rotate(box,...),
                                           plane,
                                           twospheres);

    // scale a cylinder by a factor of 2 in x and y directions, and 3 in z-direction.
    auto scylinder = EB2::scale(cylinder, {2., 2., 3.});

:cpp:`EB2::GeometryShop`
------------------------

Given an implicit function object, say :cpp:`f`, we can make a
:cpp:`GeometryShop` object with

.. highlight: c++

::

    auto shop = EB2::makeShop(f);

:cpp:`EB2::IndexSpace`
----------------------

We build :cpp:`EB2::IndexSpace` with a template function

.. highlight: c++

::

    template <typename G>
    void EB2::Build (const G& gshop, const Geometry& geom,
                     int required_coarsening_level,
                     int max_coarsening_level,
                     int ngrow = 4);

Here the template parameter is a :cpp:`EB2::GeometryShop`. :cpp:`Geometry` (see
section :ref:`sec:basics:geom`) describes the rectangular problem domain and the
mesh on the finest AMR level. Coarse level EB data is generated from coarsening
the original fine data. The :cpp:`int required_coarsening_level` parameter
specifies the number of coarsening levels required. This is usually set to
:math:`N-1`, where :math:`N` is the total number of AMR levels. The :cpp:`int
max_coarsening_levels` parameter specifies the number of coarsening levels AMReX
should try to have. This is usually set to a big number, say 20 if multigrid
solvers are used. This essentially tells the build to coarsen as much as it can.
If there are no multigrid solvers, the parameter should be set to the same as
:cpp:`required_coarsening_level`. It should be noted that coarsening could
create multi-valued cells even if the fine level does not have any multi-valued
cells. This occurs when the embedded boundary cuts a cell in such a way that
there is fluid on multiple sides of the boundary within that cell. Because
multi-valued cells are not supported, it will cause a runtime error if the
required coarsening level generates multi-valued cells. The optional :cpp:`int
ngrow` parameter specifies the number of ghost cells outside the domain on
required levels. For levels coarser than the required level, no EB data are
generated for ghost cells outside the domain.

The newly built :cpp:`EB2::IndexSpace` is pushed on to a stack. Static function
:cpp:`EB2::IndexSpace::top()` returns a :cpp:`const &` to the new
:cpp:`EB2::IndexSpace` object. We usually only need to build one
:cpp:`EB2::IndexSpace` object. However, if your application needs multiple
:cpp:`EB2::IndexSpace` objects, you can save the pointers for later use. For
simplicity, we assume there is only one `EB2::IndexSpace` object for the rest of
this chapter.

EBFArrayBoxFactory
==================

After the EB database is initialized, the next thing we build is
:cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory`. This object provides access to the EB database in the
format of basic AMReX objects such as :cpp:`BaseFab`, :cpp:`FArrayBox`,
:cpp:`FabArray`, and :cpp:`MultiFab`. We can construct it with

.. highlight: c++

::

    EBFArrayBoxFactory (const Geometry& a_geom,
                        const BoxArray& a_ba,
                        const DistributionMapping& a_dm,
                        const Vector<int>& a_ngrow,
                        EBSupport a_support);

or 

.. highlight: c++

::

    std::unique_ptr<EBFArrayBoxFactory>
    makeEBFabFactory (const Geometry& a_geom,
                      const BoxArray& a_ba,
                      const DistributionMapping& a_dm,
                      const Vector<int>& a_ngrow,
                      EBSupport a_support);

Argument :cpp:`Vector<int> const& a_ngrow` specifies the number of
ghost cells we need for EB data at various :cpp:`EBSupport` levels,
and argument :cpp:`EBSupport a_support` specifies the level of support
needed.

- :cpp:`EBSupport:basic`:  basic flags for cell types
- :cpp:`EBSupport:volume`: basic plus volume fraction and centroid
- :cpp:`EBSupport:full`: volume plus area fraction, boundary centroid
  and face centroid

:cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory` is derived from :cpp:`FabFactory<FArrayBox>`.  
:cpp:`MultiFab` constructors have an optional argument :cpp:`const
FabFactory<FArrayBox>&`.  We can use :cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory` to
build :cpp:`MultiFab`\ s that carry EB data.  Member function of
:cpp:`FabArray` 

.. highlight: c++

::

    const FabFactory<FAB>& Factory () const;

can then be used to return a reference to the :cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory` used for
building the :cpp:`MultiFab`. Using :cpp:`dynamic_cast`, we can test whether a
:cpp:`MultiFab` is built with an :cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory`.

.. highlight: c++

::

    auto factory = dynamic_cast<EBFArrayBoxFactory const*>(&(mf.Factory()));
    if (factory) {
        // this is EBFArrayBoxFactory
    } else {
        // regular FabFactory<FArrayBox>
    }

EB Data
=======

Through member functions of :cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory`, we have access to the
following data:

.. highlight: c++

::

    // see section on EBCellFlagFab
    const FabArray<EBCellFlagFab>& getMultiEBCellFlagFab () const;

    // volume fraction
    const MultiFab& getVolFrac () const;

    // volume centroid
    const MultiCutFab& getCentroid () const;

    // embedded boundary centroid
    const MultiCutFab& getBndryCent () const;

    // area fractions
    Array<const MultiCutFab*,AMREX_SPACEDIM> getAreaFrac () const;

    // face centroid
    Array<const MultiCutFab*,AMREX_SPACEDIM> getFaceCent () const;

Volume fraction is in a single-component :cpp:`MultiFab`, and it is zero for
covered cells, one for regular cells, and in between for cut cells. Centroid is
in a :cpp:`MultiCutFab` with ``AMREX_SPACEDIM`` components with each component
of the data is in the range of :math:`[-0.5,0.5]`. The centroid is based on each
cell's local coordinates with respect to the embedded boundary. A
:cpp:`MultiCutFab` is very similar to a :cpp:`MultiFab`. Its data can be
accessed with subscript operator

.. highlight: c++

::

    const CutFab& operator[] (const MFIter& mfi) const;

Here :cpp:`CutFab` is derived from :cpp:`FArrayBox` and can be passed to Fortran
just like :cpp:`FArrayBox`. The difference between :cpp:`MultiCutFab` and
:cpp:`MultiFab` is that to save memory :cpp:`MultiCutFab` only has data on boxes
that contain cut cells. It is an error to call :cpp:`operator[]` if that box
does not have cut cells. Thus the call must be in a :cpp:`if` test block (see
section :ref:`sec:EB:flag`). Boundary centroid is also a :cpp:`MultiCutFab` with
``AMREX_SPACEDIM`` components, and it uses each cell's local coordinates. Area
fractions and face centroids are returned in :cpp:`Array` of :cpp:`MultiCutFab`
pointers. For each direction, area fraction is for the face of that direction.
As for face centroids, there are two components for each direction and the
ordering is always the same as the original ordering of the coordinates. For
example, for :math:`y` face, the component 0 is for :math:`x` coordinate and 1
for :math:`z`. The coordinates are in each face's local frame normalized to the
range of :math:`[-0.5,0.5]`.

.. _sec:EB:flag:

:cpp:`EBCellFlagFab`
--------------------

:cpp:`EBCellFlagFab` contains information on cell types.  We can use
it to determine if a box contains cut cells.

.. highlight: c++

::

    auto const& flags = factory->getMultiEBCellFlagFab();
    MultiCutFab const& centroid = factory->getCentroid();
    
    for (MFIter mfi ...) {
        const Box& bx = mfi.tilebox();
        FabType t = flags[mfi].getType(bx);
        if (FabType::regular == t) {
            // This box is regular
        } else if (FabType::covered == t) {
            // This box is covered
        } else if (FabType::singlevalued == t) {
            // This box has cut cells
            // Getting cutfab is safe
            const auto& centroid_fab = centroid[mfi];
        }
    }

:cpp:`EBCellFlagFab` is derived from :cpp:`BaseFab`. Its data are stored in an
array of 32-bit integers, and can be used in C++ or passed to Fortran just like
an :cpp:`IArrayBox` (section :ref:`sec:basics:fab`). AMReX provides a Fortran
module called ``amrex_ebcellflag_module``. This module contains procedures for
testing cell types and getting neighbor information. For example

.. highlight:: fortran

::

    use amrex_ebcellflag_module, only : is_regular_cell, is_single_valued_cell, is_covered_cell

    integer, intent(in) :: flags(...)

    integer :: i,j,k

    do k = ...
        do j = ...
            do i = ...
                if (is_covered_cell(flags(i,j,k))) then
                    ! this is a completely covered cells
                else if (is_regular_cell(flags(i,j,k))) then
                    ! this is a regular cell
                else if (is_single_valued_cell(flags(i,j,k))) then
                    ! this is a cut cell
                end if
            end do     
        end do     
    end do     



.. _sec:EB:LevelSet:

Level Sets
==========

In order to speed up direct interactions with embedded boundaries, AMReX also
provides a way to construct level-sets representing the signed distance function
from the closest EB surface. In our implementation, the level-set data is stored
as a 1-component nodal :cpp:`MultiFab` (cf. :ref:`sec:basics:multifab`) where
each node stores its closest distance to the EB. The subroutine
:fortran:`amrex_eb_interp_levelset` (in ``/Scr/EB/AMREX_EB_levelset_F.F90``)
interpolates the level-set :math:`\phi(\mathbf{r})` to any position
:math:`\mathbf{r}` from the pre-computed level-set :cpp:`MultiFab`. Likewise the
subroutine :fortran:`amrex_eb_normal_levelset` interpolated the normal
:math:`\mathbf{\hat{n}}(\mathbf{r})` at any position from the derivative of the
level-set function :math:`\mathbf{\hat{n}}(\mathbf{r}) = \nabla
\phi(\mathrm{r})`. **Note** that since the normal is computed by taking the
derivative of the interpolation function, it is discontinuous at positions
corresponding to the nodal points of the level-set :cpp:`MultiFab` (i.e.
:math:`\mathbf{r} = (i, j, k) \cdot h`).

At this point, AMReX does not provide a C++ interface for interpolating the
level-set at a point. This is because so far the level-set was only needed while performing calculations in Fortran. The interpolation subroutines contained in :fortran:`amrex_eb_levelset_module` are:

.. highlight:: fortran

::

   pure subroutine amrex_eb_interp_levelset(pos, plo,  n_refine, &
                                            phi, phlo, phhi,     &
                                            dx,  phi_interp    )

and

.. highlight:: fortran

::

   pure subroutine amrex_eb_normal_levelset(pos, plo,   n_refine, &
                                            phi, phlo,  phhi,     &
                                            dx,  normal         )

which interpolate the level-set value :fortran:`phi_interp` and
:fortran:`normal`, respectively, at the 3-dimensional point :fortran:`pos`. The
nodal values of the level-set are given by the :fortran:`phi` array.
:fortran:`dx/n_refine` is the refined cell-size of the level-set array. For
example

.. highlight:: fortran

   use iso_c_binding    , only : c_int
   use amrex_fort_module, only : c_real => amrex_real

   ! ** level-set data

AMReX provides collection of functions and subroutines to fill single and
multi-level level-set data. For convenience, the :cpp:`amrex::LSFactory` helps
manage the level-set data for a single AMR level. And :cpp:`amrex::LSCore`
manages multi-level level-set data. These are described in further detail below.


A Note on Filling Level-Sets from :cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory`
-----------------------------------------------------------

The data stored in a :cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory`, represents the embedded boundary
as a discrete collection of volume fractions, and area fractions over a grid.
Here this is further simplified by thinking of the EB as a collection of planar
facets. This means that for any given node in a grid, the nearest EB facet might
be in another grid. Hence if the :cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory` has :cpp:`n_pad`
ghost cells, then for any given grid, there could be EB facets that are
:cpp:`n_pad + 1` cells away, yet we would *not* "see". In other words, if the
:cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory` is defined on a grid with spacing :math:`h`, then, and
we do not have any EB facets in the current grid, then any node within that grid
is *at least* :math:`(n_\mathrm{pad}+1)h` away from the nearest EB surface.

Hence, when filling a level-set, it will "max-out" at
:math:`\pm(n_\mathrm{pad}+1)h`. Hence it is recommended to think of this kind of
level-set function as the point being "at least" :math:`\phi(\mathbf{r})` from
the EB surface.

.. _fig::local_levelset:

.. figure:: ./EB/loc_ls_ex.png
   :width: 50.0%

   : Example of a "local" level-set representing a cylinder. The level-set
   function is a (linear) signed distance function near the EB-surface, and it
   plateaus further away from it.

Figure :numref:`fig::local_levelset` shows an example of such a local level-set
description for a cylinder. Only cells that are within
:math:`\pm(n_\mathrm{pad}+1)h` of the EB surface are filled with a level-set.
The rest is filled with lower (upper) bound. If the goal is capture interactions
between the EB surface and a point somewhere else, this approach usually
suffices as we only need to know if we are "far enough" from the EB in most
applications.

Since finding the closest distance between a point and an arbitrary surface is
computationally expensive, we advice that :cpp:`n_pad` is chosen as the smallest
necessary number for the application.


.. _ss:ls:nolsf:

Filling Level-Sets without :cpp:`LSFactory`
-------------------------------------------

The static function :cpp:`amrex::LSFactory::fill_data` (defined in
``Src/EB/AMReX_EB_levelset.cpp``) fills a :cpp:`MultiFab` with the nodal level-set
values and another :cpp:`iMultiFab` with integer tags that are 1 whenever a node
is near the EB surface. It is then left up to the application to manage the
level-set :cpp:`MultiFab`.

AMReX defines embedded surfaces using implicit functions (see above). Normally
these implicit functions are usually *not* signed distance functions (i.e. their
value at :math:`\mathbf{r}` is not the minimal distance to the EB surface).
However, in rare cases such as the :cpp:`EB2::PlaneIF`, it is. In this case, the
most straight-forward way to fill a level-set. If an signed-distance implicit
function is know, and stored as a :cpp:`MultiFab mf_impfunc`, then we can use

.. highlight:: c++

::

   static void fill_data (MultiFab & data, iMultiFab & valid,
                          const MultiFab & mf_impfunc,
                          int eb_pad, const Geometry & eb_geom);

so then the function call

.. highlight:: c++

::

   // Fill implicit function
   GShopLSFactory<EB2::CylinderIF> cylinder_lsgs(cylinder_ghsop, geom, ba, dm, 0);
   std::unique_ptr<MultiFab> cylinder_mf_impfunc = cylinder_lsgs.fill_impfunc();

   
   MultiFab ls_grid(ba, dm, 1, 0);
   iMultiFab ls_valid(ba, dm, 1, 0);
   amrex::LSFactory::fill_data(ls_grid, ls_valid, mf_impfunc, 2, geom_eb);

fills a :cpp:`MultiFab ls_grid` with level-set data given the implicit function
stored in the :cpp:`MultiFab mf_impfunc`, and a threshold of
:cpp:`2*geom_eb.CellSize()`. The helper class :cpp:`GShopLSFactory` converts EB2
implicit functions to :cpp:`MultiFabs` (defined in
``Src/EB/AMReX_EB_levelset.H``).

The much more interesting application of :cpp:`amrex::LSFactory::fill_data` is
filling a level-set given a :cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory`:

.. highlight:: c++

::

   static void fill_data (MultiFab & data, iMultiFab & valid,
                          const EBFArrayBoxFactory & eb_factory,
                          const MultiFab & eb_impfunc,
                          const IntVect & ebt_size, int ls_ref, int eb_ref,
                          const Geometry & geom, const Geometry & geom_eb);

which fills the :cpp:`MultiFab data` with level-set data from the
:cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory eb_factory`. Here the user must still supply the EB
implicit function using the :cpp:`MultiFab eb_impfunc`, as this is used to
determine the inside/outside when no EB facets can be found, or in special
edge-cases. The user also needs to specify the tile size (:cpp:`IntVect
ebt_size`), the level-set and EB refinement (i.e. the grid over which
:cpp:`data` is defined is refined by a factor of :cpp:`ls_ref/eb_ref` compared
to the :cpp:`eb_factory` 's grid), and the Geometries :cpp:`geom` and
:cpp:`geom_eb` corresponding to the grids of :cpp:`data` and :cpp:`eb_factory`
respectively.

When filling :cpp:`data`, a tile-size of :cpp:`ebt_size` is used. Only EB facets
within a tile (plus the :cpp:`eb_factory` ghost cells) are considered. Hence,
chosing an appropriate :cpp:`ebt_size` can significantly increase performance.

For example, the following fills a level-set with a cylinder EB (like that shown
in Fig. :numref:`fig::local_levelset`).

.. highlight:: c++

::

   // Define nGrow of level-set and EB
   int ls_pad = 1;
   int eb_pad = 2;

   // Define EB
   EB2::CylinderIF cylinder(radius, centre, true);
   EB2::GeometryShop<EB2::CylinderIF> cylinder_gshop(cylinder);
   
   // Build EB
   EB2::Build(cylinder_gshop, geom, max_level, max_level);
   const EB2::IndexSpace & cylinder_ebis = EB2::IndexSpace::top();
   const EB2::Level &      cylinder_lev  = cylinder_ebis.getLevel(geom);

   // Build EB factory
   EBFArrayBoxFactory eb_factory(cylinder_lev, geom, ba, dm, {eb_pad, eb_pad, eb_pad});

   // Fill implicit function
   GShopLSFactory<EB2::CylinderIF> cylinder_lsgs(cylinder_ghsop, geom, ba, dm, ls_pad);
   std::unique_ptr<MultiFab> cylinder_mf_impfunc = cylinder_lsgs.fill_impfunc();

   // Fill level-set
   MultiFab ls_grid(ba, dm, 1, ls_pad);
   iMultiFab ls_valid(ba, dm, 1, ls_pad);
   LSFactory::fill_data(ls_grid, ls_valid, eb_factory, * cylinder_mf_impfunc,
                        ebt_size, 1, 1, geom, geom);

Note that in theory the :cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory eb_factory` could be defined on
a different resolution as the the :cpp:`BoxArray ba`. In this case, the
appropriate refinements and geometries must be specified. Also note that the
thresholding behaviour (due to :cpp:`eb_pad`) is specified via the
:cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory` constructor. The implicit function MultiFab needs to
have the same grids as `data`.

Since this relies on the interplay of many different parameters, a number of
utility functions and helper classes have been created. These are discussed in
the subsequent sections.

The common operations of intersections and unions (similar to EB implicit
functions, discussed in :ref:`sec:EB:ebinit:IF`) can also be applied to
level-sets. Without the use of a :cpp:`LSFactory`, the functions:

.. highlight:: c++

::

   static void intersect_data (MultiFab & data, iMultiFab & valid,
                               const MultiFab & data_in, const iMultiFab & valid_in,
                               const Geometry & geom_ls);

and  

.. highlight:: c++

::

   static void union_data (MultiFab & data, iMultiFab & valid,
                           const MultiFab & data_in, const iMultiFab & valid_in,
                           const Geometry & geom_ls);

These apply the intersection (element-wise minimum) and union (maximum) between
the :cpp:`MultiFab data`, and :cpp:`data_in`. The result overwrites the contents
of :cpp:`data`. The tags stored in the :cpp:`iMultiFab valid_in` determine where
the intersection takes place (i.e. only cells where both :cpp:`valid_in == 1`
are intersected, others are ignored).


Using :cpp:`LSFactory`
----------------------

In the previous section, we've seen that the level-set and EB grids can exist on
different levels of refinement. The practical reason behind this is that
sometimes we want to capture interactions that are very sensitive close to EBs,
but this can sometimes be difficult to keep track of. Hence the :cpp:`LSFactory`
can be helpful in taking care of all of these parameters.

The basic principle of the :cpp:`LSFactory` (defined in
``Src/EB/AMReX_EB_levelset.H``) is that it is created relative to some reference
:cpp:`BoxArray ba`, :cpp:`Geometry geom`, and :cpp:`DistributionMapping dm`. The
user then specifies refinement factors :cpp:`ls_ref` of the level-set data and
:cpp:`eb_ref` of the EB grid. Calling the constructor:

.. highlight:: c++

::

   LSFactory(int lev, int ls_ref, int eb_ref, int ls_pad, int eb_pad,
             const BoxArray & ba, const Geometry & geom, const DistributionMapping & dm,
             int eb_tile_size = 32);

Then creates all appropriate grids and geometries. Note that we can also specify
the tile size used internally in the :cpp:`LSFactory::fill_data` function.

When a :cpp:`LSFacotry` is first created, its level-set values are set to
:fortran:`huge(amrex_real)`. I. e. there are no surfaces, and so the level-set
value is effectively infinite. It can then be filled just like in the previous
section:

.. highlight:: c++

::

   // Define refinement of level-set and EB
   int ls_ref = 4;
   int eb_ref = 1;

   // Define nGrow of level-set and EB
   int ls_pad = 1;
   int eb_pad = 2;

   // Define EB
   EB2::CylinderIF cylinder(radius, centre, true);
   EB2::GeometryShop<EB2::CylinderIF> cylinder_gshop(cylinder);

   // Build level-set factory
   LSFactory level_set(0, ls_ref, eb_ref, ls_pad, eb_pad, ba, geom, dm);

   // Build EB
   const Geometry & eb_geom = level_set.get_eb_geom()
   EB2::Build(cylinder_gshop, eb_geom, max_level, max_level);

   const EB2::IndexSpace & cylinder_ebis = EB2::IndexSpace::top();
   const EB2::Level &      cylinder_lev  = cylinder_ebis.getLevel(eb_geom);

   // Build EB factory
   EBFArrayBoxFactory eb_factory(cylinder_lev, eb_geom, level_set.get_eb_ba(), dm,
                                 {level_set.get_eb_pad(), level_set.get_eb_pad(),
                                  level_set.get_eb_pad()});

   // Fill level-set (factory)
   GShopLSFactory<EB2::CylinderIF> cylinder_lsgs(cylinder_ghsop, level_set);
   std::unique_ptr<MultiFab> cylinder_mf_impfunc = cylinder_lsgs.fill_impfunc();
   level_set.Fill(eb_factory, * cylinder_mf_impfunc);

where the level-set data can now be accessed using:

.. highlight:: c++

::

   const MultiFab * level_set_data = level_set.get_data();

or alternatively a copy of the data can be generated using:

.. highlight:: c++

::

   std::unique_ptr<MultiFab> level_set_data = level_set.copy_data();

Both of the data above are on grids that have been refined by :cpp:`ls_ref`
(with respect to the :cpp:`BoxArray ba`). In order to get a copy of the
level-set data at the coarseness of the original grids, use:

.. highlight:: c++

::

   std::unique_ptr<MultiFab> level_set_data_crse = level_set.coarsen_data();

Note however, that the level-set data is nodal data. Therefore, even though the
:cpp:`MultiFab level_set_data_crse` is defined on a grid with the same
resolution as the :cpp:`BoxArray ba`, it is defined on the nodal version of that
grid.

The :cpp:`LSFactory` is also there to make operations on the level-set easier.
Intersection and Union operations with EB factories and implicit functions are
available in the :cpp:`LSFactory` class. As well as functions to regrid
(updating the underlying :cpp:`BoxArray` and :cpp:`DistributionMapping`),
copying, and inverting the level-set function.


Filling Multi-Level Level-Sets without :cpp:`LSCore`
----------------------------------------------------

AMReX also provides code to fill the level-set function on different levels of
refinement. The static function :cpp:`amrex::LSCoreBase::FillLevelSet`,
:cpp:`amrex::LSCoreBase::MakeNewLevelFromCoarse`, and
:cpp:`amrex::LSCoreBase::FillVolfracTags` (or
:cpp:`amrex::LSCoreBase::FillLevelSetTags` for level-set tagging instead of
volume-fraction tagging) fill a finer level from a coarse one. Just like the
section on :ref:`ss:ls:nolsf`, the philosophy here is to enable to user to fill
a :cpp:`MultiFab` with level-set values, and manage this data structure
themselves. Later we will discuss the :cpp:`LSCore` class, which automatically
constructs multi-level level-sets.

One common problem with level-set function is that they are expensive to
compute. Therefore, a strategy would be to compromise by computing the level-set
function accurately near embedded boundaries (where precision is important), and
at a lower resolution for from walls. The function

.. highlight:: c++

::

   static void FillVolfracTags( int lev, TagBoxArray & tags,
                                 const Vector<BoxArray> & grids,
                                 const Vector<DistributionMapping> & dmap,
                                 const EB2::Level & eb_lev, const Vector<Geometry> & geom );

fills a :cpp:`TagBoxArray` with tags wherever the volume fraction is between 0
and 1. This way any cut-cells a buffered of :cpp:`amr.n_error_buf` many
neighbors is tagged for refinement. If we need finer control over the tagging,
the function

.. highlight:: c++

::

   static void FillLevelSetTags( int lev, TagBoxArray & tags, const Vector<Real> & phierr,
                                 const MultiFab & levelset_data, const Vector<Geometry> & geom );

takes a list of threshold level-set values (:cpp:`Vector<Real> & phierr`) and
tags cells for refinement if the coarse estimate of the levelset
(:cpp:`levelset_data`) from level :cpp:`lev` is less than :cpp:`phierr[lev]`.

The following code would then fill a multi-level hierarchy of level-sets
contained in :cpp:`Vector<MultiFab> level_sets`.

.. highlight:: c++

::

   //___________________________________________________________________________
   // Start with level zero

   EBFArrayBoxFactory eb_factory(* eb_levels[0], geom[0], grids[0], dmap[0],
                                 {eb_pad, eb_pad, leb_pad}, EBSupport::full);

   // NOTE: reference BoxArray is not nodal
   BoxArray nd_ba = amrex::convert(grids[0], IntVect::TheNodeVector());

   level_sets[0].define(nd_ba, dmap[0], 1, pad);
   iMultiFab valid(nd_ba, dmap[0], 1, pad);

   // NOTE: implicit function data might not be on the right grids
   MultiFab impfunc = MFUtil::regrid(nd_ba, dmap[0], implicit_functions[0], true);

   LSFactory::fill_data(level_sets[0], valid, ebfactory, impfunc,
                        32, 1, 1, geom[0], geom[0]);


   //___________________________________________________________________________
   // Fill finer levels, using coarser level to estimate level-set

   for (int lev = 1; lev < nlev; lev++) {
            // NOTE: reference BoxArray is not nodal
            BoxArray ba = amrex::convert(grids[lev], IntVect::TheNodeVector());
            level_sets[lev].reset(new MultiFab);
            iMultiFab valid(ba, dmap[lev], 1, pad);

            // Fills level_sets[lev] with coarse data
            LSCoreBase::MakeNewLevelFromCoarse( level_sets[lev], level_sets[lev-1],
                                               ba, dmap[lev], geom[lev], geom[lev-1],
                                               bcs_ls, refRatio(lev-1));

            EBFArrayBoxFactory eb_factory(* eb_levels[lev], geom[lev], grids[lev], dmap[lev],
                                          {eb_pad, eb_pad, eb_pad}, EBSupport::full);

            // NOTE: implicit function data might not be on the right grids
            MultiFab impfunc = MFUtil::regrid(ba, dmap[lev], implicit_functions[lev]);

            IntVect ebt_size{AMREX_D_DECL(32, 32, 32)}; // Fudge factors...
            LSCoreBase::FillLevelSet(level_sets[lev], level_sets[lev], eb_factory, impfunc,
                                     ebt_size, eb_pad, geom[lev]);
        }

Here the :cpp:`Vector<const EB2::Level *> eb_levels` has been filled while
initializing the embedded boundaries. At the same time, the implicit functions
need to be saved to :cpp:`Vector<MultiFab> implicit_functions`. The user also
needs to specify the level-set boundary conditions in :cpp:`Vector<BCRec>
bcs_ls`. Note that the function :cpp:`LSCoreBase::FillLevelSet` uses the coarse
level-set as an upper bound to the tile size used for testing EB facets.



Using :cpp:`LSCore`
-------------------

The process described in the previous section is automated in the :cpp:`LSCore`
class. It is derived from :cpp:`LSCoreBase`, which in turn is derived from
:cpp:`AmrCore` (cf. :ref:`Chap:AmrCore`). :cpp:`LSCore` is a template class
depending on the embedded boundary implicit function. This way, it can build new
:cpp:`EB2::Level` objects for every new level that is needed.

Since :cpp:`LSCore` is a template class, it might lead to problems in
applications where the template parameter can depend of runtime parameters. This
is the reason why it derives from the base class :cpp:`LSCoreBase`.
:cpp:`LSCore` overwrites the virtual function :cpp:`MakeNewLevelFromScratch` in
:cpp:`LSCoreBase`. The application can then employ the following polymorphism to
construct the level-set;

.. highlight:: c++

::

   LSCoreBase * ls_core;

   // sets ls_core pointer
   make_my_eb(ls_core);

   ls_core->InitData();

where the function :cpp:`make_my_eb` defines the actual EB geometry:

.. highlight:: c++

::

   void make_my_eb(LSCoreBase *& ls_core) {

       // MyIF is an EB2 Implicit Fuction
       GeometryShop<MyIF> gshop;

       // Build an EB geometry shop here

       ls_core = new LSCore<MyIF>(gshop);
   }

Here the :cpp:`make_my_eb` is only defines the EB geometry. The function call
:cpp:`ls_core->InitData()` constructs level hierarchy and fills it with
level-set values.



Linear Solvers
==============

Linear solvers for the canonical form (equation :eq:`eqn::abeclap`)
have been discussed in chapter :ref:`Chap:LinearSolvers`.  Currently,
AMReX supports cell-centered solver with homogeneous Neumann boundary
condition on the EB. A cell-centered solver with Dirichlet boundary
condition on the EB and a nodal solver are under development.

To use cell-centered solver for EB, one builds linear operator
:cpp:`MLEBABecLap` with :cpp:`EBFArrayBoxFactory`.

.. highlight:: c++

::

    MLEBABecLap (const Vector<Geometry>& a_geom,
                 const Vector<BoxArray>& a_grids,
                 const Vector<DistributionMapping>& a_dmap,
                 const LPInfo& a_info,
                 const Vector<EBFArrayBoxFactory const*>& a_factory);

The usage of this EB specified class is essentially the same as
:cpp:`MLABecLaplacian`.
