Compiling AMReX with CVODE (Cray or Sundials version 2.7)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The following steps describe how to compile an AMReX application with
CVODE support.  On Cray systems (e.g., Cori or Edison at NERSC), Cray provides
a system module called ``cray-tpsl`` ("Cray Third-Party Scientific Libraries")
which contains the latest version of the SUNDIALS solver suite (including
CVODE).  Simply type ``module load cray-tpsl`` and set ``USE_CVODE=TRUE`` in
the ``GNUmakefile``, and AMReX will automatically link the SUNDIALS libraries.

On systems which are not Cray:

#. Obtain the CVODE source code, which is hosted here:
   https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software.
   One can download either the complete SUNDIALS package, or just the CVODE components.

#. Unpack the CVODE / SUNDIALS tarball, and create a new "build" directory (it
   can be anywhere).

#. Navigate to the new, empty build directory, and type

   ::

         cmake \
           -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path/to/install/dir \
           /path/to/cvode/or/sundials/top/level/source/dir


   The ``CMAKE_INSTALL_DIR`` option tells CMake where to install the libraries.
   Note that CMake will attempt to deduce the compilers automatically, but
   respects certain environment variables if they are defined, such as ``CC``
   (for the C compiler), ``CXX`` (for the C++ compiler), and ``FC`` (for the
   Fortran compiler).  So one may modify the above CMake invocation to be
   something like the following:

   ::

         CC=/path/to/gcc \
         CXX=/path/to/g++ \
         FC=/path/to/gfortran \
           cmake \
           -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path/to/install/dir \
           /path/to/cvode/or/sundials/top/level/source/dir


   One can supply additional flags to CMake or to the compiler to customize the
   compilation process.  Flags of interest may include ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS``, which
   add the specified flags to the compile statement, e.g.,
   ``-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-h list=a"`` will append the ``-h list=a`` flag to the
   ``cc`` statement when compiling the source code.  Here one may wish to add
   something like ``"-O2 -g"`` to provide an optimized library that still
   contains debugging symbols; if one neglects debugging symbols in the CVODE
   library, and if a code that uses CVODE encounters a segmentation fault in
   the solve, then the backtrace has no information about where in the solver
   the error occurred.  Also, if one wishes to compile only the solver library
   itself and not the examples that come with the source (compiling the
   examples is enabled by default), one can add ``"-DEXAMPLES_ENABLE=OFF"``.
   Users should be aware that the CVODE examples are linked dynamically, so
   when compiling the solver library on Cray system using the Cray compiler
   wrappers ``cc``, ``CC``, and ``ftn``, one should explicitly disable
   compiling the examples via the ``"-DEXAMPLES_ENABLE=OFF"`` flag.

#. In the ``GNUmakefile`` for the application which uses the Fortran 2003
   interface to , add ``USE_CVODE = TRUE``, which will compile the Fortran 2003
   interfaces and link the libraries.  Note that one must define the
   ``CVODE_LIB_DIR`` environment variable to point to the location where the
   libraries are installed.

CVODE Tutorials
------------------

AMReX provides two CVODE tutorials in the ``amrex/Tutorials/CVODE`` directory, called
``EX1`` and ``EX2``.  See the Tutorials CVODE_ documentation for more detail.
