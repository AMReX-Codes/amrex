Basics
===================

In this chapter, we present the basics of AMReX. The implementation source
codes are in ``amrex/Src/Base/``. Note that AMReX classes and functions are in
namespace ``amrex``. For clarity, we usually drop ``amrex::`` in the example
codes here. It is also assumed that headers have been properly included. We
recommend you study the tutorial in
``amrex/Tutorials/Basic/HeatEquation_EX1_C`` while reading this chapter.  After
reading this chapter, one should be able to develop single-level parallel codes
using AMReX. It should also be noted that this is not a comprehensive reference
manual.
