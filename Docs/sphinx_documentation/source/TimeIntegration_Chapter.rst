Time Integration
================

AMReX provides a basic explicit time integrator capable of Forward Euler or
both predefined and custom Runge-Kutta schemes designed to advance data on a
particular AMR level by a timestep. This integrator is designed to be flexible,
requiring the user to supply a right-hand side function taking a ``MultiFab``
of state data and filling a ``MultiFab`` of the corresponding right hand side
data. The user simply needs to supply a C++ lambda function to implement
whatever right hand side operations they need.

A Simple Time Integrator Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is best shown with some sample code that sets up a time integrator and
asks it to step forwards by some interval ``dt``. The user needs to supply at
minimum, the right-hand side function using the ``TimeIntegrator::set_rhs()``
function. A user can also supply a post update function which is called on
state data immediately before evaluating the right-hand side. This post update
function is a good opportunity to fill boundary conditions for Runge-Kutta
stage solution data so that ghost cells are filled when the right hand side
function is called on that solution data.

::

   #include <AMReX_TimeIntegrator.H>

   MultiFab Sborder; // MultiFab containing old-time state data and ghost cells
   MultiFab Snew;    // MultiFab where we want new-time state data
   Geometry geom;    // The domain (or level) geometry

   // [Fill Sborder here]

   // Create a time integrator that will work with
   // MultiFabs with the same BoxArray, DistributionMapping,
   // and number of components as the state_data MultiFab.
   TimeIntegrator<MultiFab> integrator(Sborder);

   // Create a RHS source function we will integrate
   auto source_fun = [&](MultiFab& rhs, const MultiFab& state, const Real time){
       // User function to calculate the rhs MultiFab given the state MultiFab
       fill_rhs(rhs, state, time);
   };

   // Create a function to call after updating a state
   auto post_update_fun = [&](MultiFab& S_data, const Real time) {
       // Call user function to update state MultiFab, e.g. fill BCs
       post_update(S_data, time, geom);
   };

   // Attach the right hand side and post-update functions
   // to the integrator
   integrator.set_rhs(source_fun);
   integrator.set_post_update(post_update_fun);

   // integrate forward one step from `time` by `dt` to fill S_new
   integrator.advance(Sborder, S_new, time, dt);


Picking A Time Integration Method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The user can customize which integration method they wish to use with a set of
runtime parameters that allow choosing between a simple Forward Euler method or
a generic explicit Runge-Kutta method. If Runge-Kutta is selected, then the
user can choose which of a set of predefined Butcher Tables to use, or can
choose to use a custom table and supply it manually. The options are detailed as follows:

::

  # INTEGRATION
  ## integration.type can take on the following values:
  ## 0 = Forward Euler
  ## 1 = Explicit Runge Kutta
  integration.type = 1

  ## Explicit Runge-Kutta parameters
  #
  ## integration.rk.type can take the following values:
  ### 0 = User-specified Butcher Tableau
  ### 1 = Forward Euler
  ### 2 = Trapezoid Method
  ### 3 = SSPRK3 Method
  ### 4 = RK4 Method
  integration.rk.type = 3

  ## If using a user-specified Butcher Tableau, then
  ## set nodes, weights, and table entries here:
  #
  ## The Butcher Tableau is read as a flattened,
  ## lower triangular matrix (but including the diagonal)
  ## in row major format.
  integration.rk.weights = 1
  integration.rk.nodes = 0
  integration.rk.tableau = 0.0
