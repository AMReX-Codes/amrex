Welcome to AMReX's documentation
================================

AMReX is a software framework containing all the functionality to write
massively parallel, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications. AMReX is freely available `on Github
<https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex>`_.

AMReX is developed at LBNL, NREL, and ANL as part of the Block-Structured AMR
Co-Design Center in DOE's Exascale Computing Project.

All of AMReX's development is done in the github repository under the
development branch; anyone can see the latest updates. A monthly release is tagged at the beginning
of each month.

We are always happy to have users contribute to the AMReX source code. To
contribute, issue a pull request against the development branch (details `here
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`_).  Any level of
changes are welcomed: documentation, bug fixes, new test problems, new solvers,
etc.  To obtain help, simply post an
`issue <https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex/issues>`_
on the AMReX GitHub webpage.

There are small stand-alone example codes that demonstrate how to use different parts of the AMReX functionality;
there is extensive documentation for these tutorial codes at :ref:`amrex_tutorials:amrex_tut_indx`

Besides this documentation, there is API documentation generated by `Doxygen
<https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/doxygen>`_.

Documentation on migration from BoxLib is available in the AMReX repository at Docs/Migration.
