Building AMReX
===================

In this chapter, we discuss AMReX's build systems.  Additionally, it
is also possible to install AMReX using spack (https://spack.io/).

There are three ways to use AMReX's build systems. Most AMReX
developers use GNU Make. With this approach, there is no installation
step; application codes adopt AMReX's build system and compile AMReX
while compiling their own codes. This will be discussed in more detail
in the section on :ref:`sec:build:make`.

The second approach is to build and install AMReX as a library using GNU make (:ref:`sec:build:lib`);
an application code then uses its own build system and links to AMReX as an external library.

Finally, AMReX can also be built with CMake, as detailed in the section on :ref:`sec:build:cmake`.

AMReX requires a C++ compiler that supports the C++11 standard, a
Fortran compiler that supports the Fortran 2003 standard, and a C
compiler that supports the C99 standard.  Prerequisites for building
with GNU Make include Python (>= 2.7, including 3) and standard tools
available in any Unix-like environments (e.g., Perl and sed).  For
building with CMake, the minimal requirement is version 3.14.

Please note that we fully support AMReX for Linux systems in general and on the
DOE supercomputers (e.g. Cori, Summit) in particular.  Many of our users do build
and use AMReX on Macs but we do not have the resources to fully support Mac users.
