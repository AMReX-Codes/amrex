AMReX Introduction
==================

AMReX is a publicly available software framework designed for building
massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications. AMReX is freely available at
https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex.

Key features of AMReX include:

-  C++ and Fortran interfaces

-  1-, 2- and 3-D support

-  Support for cell-centered, face-centered, edge-centered, and nodal data

-  Support for hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic solves on hierarchical
   adaptive grid structure

-  Optional subcycling in time for time-dependent PDEs

-  Support for particles

-  Parallelization via flat MPI, OpenMP, hybrid MPI/OpenMP, or MPI/MPI

-  Parallel I/O

-  Plotfile format supported by AmrVis, VisIt, ParaView, and yt.

AMReX is developed at LBNL, NREL, and ANL as part of the Block-Structured AMR
Co-Design Center in DOE's Exascale Computing Project. 

All of AMReX's development is done in the github repository under the
development branch; anyone can see the latest updates. Changes are merged into
the master branch at the beginning of each month.

We are always happy to have users contribute to the AMReX source code. To
contribute, issue a pull request against the development branch (details at
https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).  Any level of
changes are welcomed: documentation, bug fixes, new test problems, new solvers,
...

To obtain help, simply post an issue in the AMReX GitHub webpage at
https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex

Besides this documentation, there is documentation generated by Doxygen at
https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/doxygen. Documentation on migration from
BoxLib is available in the main amrex repository at Docs/Migration.
