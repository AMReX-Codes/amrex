AMReX Introduction
==================

AMReX is a publicly available software framework designed for building
massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications.

Key features of AMReX include:

-  C++ and Fortran interfaces

-  1-, 2- and 3-D support

-  Support for cell-centered, face-centered, edge-centered, and nodal data

-  Support for hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic solves on hierarchical
   adaptive grid structure

-  Optional subcycling in time for time-dependent PDEs

-  Support for particles

-  Parallelization via flat MPI, OpenMP, hybrid MPI/OpenMP, or MPI/MPI

-  Parallel I/O

-  Plotfile format supported by AmrVis, VisIt, ParaView, and yt.

AMReX is developed at LBNL, NREL, and ANL as part of the Block-Structured AMR
Co-Design Center in DOE's Exascale Computing Project.
