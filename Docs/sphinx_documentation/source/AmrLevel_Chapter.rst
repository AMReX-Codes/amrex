Amr Source Code
===============

The source code in ``amrex/Src/Amr`` contains a number of classes, most notably
:cpp:`Amr`, :cpp:`AmrLevel`, and :cpp:`LevelBld`.
These classes provide a more well developed set of tools for writing AMR codes
than the classes created for the Advection_AmrCore tutorial.

-  The :cpp:`Amr` class is derived from :cpp:`AmrCore`, and manages data across the
   entire AMR hierarchy of grids.

-  The :cpp:`AmrLevel` class is a pure virtual class for managing data at a
   single level of refinement.

-  The :cpp:`LevelBld` class is a pure virtual class for defining variable types
   and attributes.

Many of our mature, public application codes contain derived classes that
inherit directly from :cpp:`AmrLevel`. These include our compressible
astrophysics code, CASTRO, (available in the AMReX-Astro/Castro github
repository) and our computational cosmology code, Nyx (available in the
AMReX-Astro/Nyx github repository) .  Our incompressible Navier-Stokes code,
IAMR (available in the AMReX-codes/IAMR github repository) has a pure virtual
class called :cpp:`NavierStokesBase` that inherits from :cpp:`AmrLevel`, and an
additional derived class :cpp:`NavierStokes`.  Our low Mach number combustion
code PeleLM (not yet public) also inherits from :cpp:`NavierStokesBase`.

The tutorial code in ``amrex/Tutorials/Amr/Advection_AmrLevel`` gives a simple
example of a class derived from :cpp:`AmrLevel` that can be used to solve the
advection equation on a subcycling-in-time AMR hierarchy. Note that example is
essentially the same as the ``amrex/Tutorials/Amr/Advection_AmrCore`` tutorial and
documentation in the chapter on :ref:`Chap:AmrCore`, except now we use the
provided libraries in ``amrex/Src/Amr``.

The tutorial code also contains a :cpp:`LevelBldAdv` class (derived from
:cpp:`LevelBld` in the Source/Amr directory). This class is used to define
variable types (how many, nodality, interlevel interpolation stencils, etc.).
