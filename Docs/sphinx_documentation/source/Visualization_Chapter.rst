=============

There are several visualization tools that can be used for AMReX plotfiles. The
standard tool used within the AMReX-community is Amrvis, a package developed
and supported by CCSE that is designed specifically for highly efficient
visualization of block-structured hierarchical AMR data. Plotfiles can also be
viewed using the VisIt, ParaView, and yt packages. Particle data can be viewed
using ParaView.
