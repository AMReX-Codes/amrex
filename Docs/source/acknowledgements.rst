Funding and Acknowledgements
============================

WarpX is supported by the Exascale Computing Project (17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of two U.S. Department of Energy organizations (Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration) responsible for the planning and preparation of a capable exascale ecosystem, including software, applications, hardware, advanced system engineering, and early testbed platforms, in support of the nation's exascale computing imperative.

We acknowledge all the contributors and users of the WarpX community who participate to the code quality with valuable code improvement and important feedback.
