abstract = {A new absorbing boundary condition using an absorbing layer is presented for application to finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculation of the wave equation. This algorithm is by construction a hybrid between the Berenger perfectly matched layer (PML) algorithm and the one-way Sommerfeld algorithm. The new prescription contains both of these earlier ones as particular cases, and retains benefits from both. Numerical results indicate that the new algorithm provides absorbing rates superior to those of the PML algorithm.},

@article{Habib2016,
abstract = {This draft report summarizes and details the findings, results, and recommendations derived from the ASCR/HEP Exascale Requirements Review meeting held in June, 2015. The main conclusions are as follows. 1) Larger, more capable computing and data facilities are needed to support HEP science goals in all three frontiers: Energy, Intensity, and Cosmic. The expected scale of the demand at the 2025 timescale is at least two orders of magnitude -- and in some cases greater -- than that available currently. 2) The growth rate of data produced by simulations is overwhelming the current ability, of both facilities and researchers, to store and analyze it. Additional resources and new techniques for data analysis are urgently needed. 3) Data rates and volumes from HEP experimental facilities are also straining the ability to store and analyze large and complex data volumes. Appropriately configured leadership-class facilities can play a transformational role in enabling scientific discovery from these datasets. 4) A close integration of HPC simulation and data analysis will aid greatly in interpreting results from HEP experiments. Such an integration will minimize data movement and facilitate interdependent workflows. 5) Long-range planning between HEP and ASCR will be required to meet HEP's research needs. To best use ASCR HPC resources the experimental HEP program needs a) an established long-term plan for access to ASCR computational and data resources, b) an ability to map workflows onto HPC resources, c) the ability for ASCR facilities to accommodate workflows run by collaborations that can have thousands of individual members, d) to transition codes to the next-generation HPC platforms that will be available at ASCR facilities, e) to build up and train a workforce capable of developing and using simulations and analysis to support HEP scientific research on next-generation systems.},

Compared to therapy accelerators like synchrotrons and cyclotrons, laser technology is advantageous in that it is more compact and is simpler in delivering ions from the accelerator to the treatment room.

abstract = {Simulating laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in a Lorentz boosted frame in which the plasma drifts towards the laser with nu(b) can speed up the simulation by factors of gamma(2)(b) = (1 nu(2)(b)/c(2))(-1). In these simulations the relativistic drifting plasma inevitably induces a high frequency numerical instability that contaminates the interesting physics. Various approaches have been proposed to mitigate this instability. One approach is to solve Maxwell equations in Fourier space (a spectral solver) as this has been shown to suppress the fastest growing modes of this instability in simple test problems using a simple low pass or "ring" or "shell" like filters in Fourier space. We describe the development of a fully parallelized, multi-dimensional, particle-in-cell code that uses a spectral solver to solve Maxwell's equations and that includes the ability to launch a laser using a moving antenna. This new EM-PIC code is called UPIC-EMMA and it is based on the components of the UCLA PIC framework (UPIC). We show that by using UPIC-EMMA, LWFA simulations in the boosted frames with arbitrary yb can be conducted without the presence of the numerical instability. We also compare the results of a few LWFA cases for several values of yb, including lab frame simulations using OSIRIS, an EM-PIC code with a finite-difference time domain (FDTD) Maxwell solver. These comparisons include cases in both linear and nonlinear regimes. We also investigate some issues associated with numerical dispersion in lab and boosted frame simulations and between FDTD and spectral solvers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present improvements to the three-dimensional (3D) quasi-static particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm, which is used to efficiently model short-pulse laser and particle beam–plasma interactions. In this algorithm the fields including the index of refraction created by a static particle/laser beam are calculated. These fields are then used to advance the particle/laser beam forward in time (distance). For a 3D quasi-static code, calculating the wake fields is done using a two-dimensional (2D) PIC code where the time variable is $\xi$=ct-z and z is the propagation direction of the particle/laser beam. When calculating the wake, the fields, particle positions and momenta are not naturally time centered so an iterative predictor corrector loop is required. In the previous iterative loop in QuickPIC (currently the only 3D quasi-static PIC code), the field equations are derived using the Lorentz gauge. Here we describe a new algorithm which uses gauge independent field equations. It is found that with this new algorithm, the results converge to the results from fully explicitly PIC codes with far fewer iterations (typically 1 iteration as compared to 2–8) for a wide range of problems. In addition, we describe a new deposition scheme for directly depositing the time derivative of the current that is needed in one of the field equations. The new deposition scheme does not require message passing for the particles inside the iteration loop, which greatly improves the speed for parallelized calculations. Comparisons of results from the new and old algorithms and to fully explicit PIC codes are also presented.},

abstract = {Neutralized drift compression offers an effective means for particle beam pulse compression and current amplification. In neutralized drift compression, a linear longitudinal velocity tilt (head-to-tail gradient) is applied to the non-relativistic beam pulse, so that the beam pulse compresses as it drifts in the focusing section. The beam current can increase by more than a factor of 100 in the longitudinal direction. We have performed an analytical study of how errors in the velocity tilt acquired by the beam in the induction bunching module limit the maximum longitudinal compression. It is found that the compression ratio is determined by the relative errors in the velocity tilt. That is, one-percent errors may limit the compression to a factor of one hundred. However, a part of the beam pulse where the errors are small may compress to much higher values, which are determined by the initial thermal spread of the beam pulse. It is also shown that sharp jumps in the compressed current density profile can be produced due to overlaying of different parts of the pulse near the focal plane. Examples of slowly varying and rapidly varying errors compared to the beam pulse duration are studied. For beam velocity errors given by a cubic function, the compression ratio can be described analytically. In this limit, a significant portion of the beam pulse is located in the broad wings of the pulse and is poorly compressed. The central part of the compressed pulse is determined by the thermal spread. The scaling law for maximum compression ratio is derived. In addition to a smooth variation in the velocity tilt, fast-changing errors during the pulse may appear in the induction bunching module if the voltage pulse is formed by several pulsed elements. Different parts of the pulse compress nearly simultaneously at the target and the compressed profile may have many peaks. The maximum compression is a function of both thermal spread and the velocity errors. The effects of the finite gap width of the bunching module on compression are analyzed analytically. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pseudo-spectral electromagnetic solvers (i.e. representing the fields in Fourier space) have extraordinary precision. In particular, Haber et al. presented in 1973 a pseudo-spectral solver that integrates analytically the solution over a finite time step, under the usual assumption that the source is constant over that time step. Yet, pseudo-spectral solvers have not been widely used, due in part to the difficulty for efficient parallelization owing to global communications associated with global FFTs on the entire computational domains.A method for the parallelization of electromagnetic pseudo-spectral solvers is proposed and tested on single electromagnetic pulses, and on Particle-In-Cell simulations of the wakefield formation in a laser plasma accelerator.The method takes advantage of the properties of the Discrete Fourier Transform, the linearity of Maxwell's equations and the finite speed of light for limiting the communications of data within guard regions between neighboring computational domains.Although this requires a small approximation, test results show that no significant error is made on the test cases that have been presented.The proposed method opens the way to solvers combining the favorable parallel scaling of standard finite-difference methods with the accuracy advantages of pseudo-spectral methods. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a customized finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) Maxwell solver for the particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm. The solver is customized to effectively eliminate the numerical Cerenkov instability (NCI) which arises when a plasma (neutral or non-neutral) relativistically drifts on a grid when using the PIC algorithm. We control the EM dispersion curve in the direction of the plasma drift of a FDTD Maxwell solver by using a customized higher order finite difference operator for the spatial derivative along the direction of the drift ({\$}\backslashhat 1{\$} direction). We show that this eliminates the main NCI modes with moderate {\$}\backslashvert k{\_}1 \backslashvert{\$}, while keeps additional main NCI modes well outside the range of physical interest with higher {\$}\backslashvert k{\_}1 \backslashvert{\$}. These main NCI modes can be easily filtered out along with first spatial aliasing NCI modes which are also at the edge of the fundamental Brillouin zone. The customized solver has the possible advantage of improved parallel scalability because it can be easily partitioned along {\$}\backslashhat 1{\$} which typically has many more cells than other directions for the problems of interest. We show that FFTs can be performed locally to current on each partition to filter out the main and first spatial aliasing NCI modes, and to correct the current so that it satisfies the continuity equation for the customized spatial derivative. This ensures that Gauss' Law is satisfied. We present simulation examples of one relativistically drifting plasmas, of two colliding relativistically drifting plasmas, and of nonlinear laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in a Lorentz boosted frame that show no evidence of the NCI can be observed when using this customized Maxwell solver together with its NCI elimination scheme.},

abstract = {Near-monoenergetic photon sources at MeV energies offer improved sensitivity at greatly reduced dose for active interrogation, and new capabilities in treaty verification, nondestructive assay of spent nuclear fuel and emergency response. Thomson (also referred to as Compton) scattering sources are an established method to produce appropriate photon beams. Applications are however restricted by the size of the required high-energy electron linac, scattering (photon production) system, and shielding for disposal of the high energy electron beam. Laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) produce GeV electron beams in centimeters, using the plasma wave driven by the radiation pressure of an intense laser. Recent LPA experiments are presented which have greatly improved beam quality and efficiency, rendering them appropriate for compact high-quality photon sources based on Thomson scattering. Designs for MeV photon sources utilizing the unique properties of LPAs are presented. It is shown that control of the scattering laser, including plasma guiding, can increase photon production efficiency. This reduces scattering laser size and/or electron beam current requirements to scale compatible with the LPA. Lastly, the plasma structure can decelerate the electron beam after photon production, reducing the size of shielding required for beam disposal. Together, these techniques provide a path to a compact photon source system.},

When simulating relativistic beams and streaming plasmas in multiple dimensions, they are, however, subject to the numerical Cherenkov instability. Previous studies have shown that instability growth rates can be reduced substantially by modifying slightly the transverse fields as seen by the streaming particles. Here, we offer an approach which completely eliminates the fundamental mode of the numerical Cherenkov instability while minimizing the transverse field corrections. The procedure, numerically computed residual growth rates (from weaker, higher order instability aliases), and comparisons with simulations using the code Warp are presented. In some instances, there are no numerical instabilities whatsoever, at least in the linear regime.},

It is, however, not free of the usual numerical instabilities, including the numerical Cherenkov instability, when applied to relativistic beam simulations. This paper derives and solves the numerical dispersion relation for the PSATD algorithm and compares the results with corresponding behavior of the more conventional pseudo-spectral time-domain (PSTD) and finite difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithms. In general, PSATD offers superior stability properties over a reasonable range of time steps. More importantly, one version of the PSATD algorithm, when combined with digital filtering, is almost completely free of the numerical Cherenkov instability for time steps (scaled to the speed of light) comparable to or smaller than the axial cell size. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A hybrid Maxwell solver for fully relativistic and electromagnetic (EM) particle-in-cell (PIC) codes is described. In this solver, the EM fields are solved in k space by performing an FFT in one direction, while using finite difference operators in the other direction(s). This solver eliminates the numerical Cerenkov radiation for particles moving in the preferred direction. Moreover, the numerical Cerenkov instability (NCI) induced by the relativistically drifting plasma and beam can be eliminated using this hybrid solver by applying strategies that are similar to those recently developed for pure FFT solvers. A current correction is applied for the charge conserving current deposit to ensure that Gauss's Law is satisfied. A theoretical analysis of the dispersion properties in vacuum and in a drifting plasma for the hybrid solver is presented, and compared with PIC simulations with good agreement obtained. This hybrid solver is applied to both 2D and 3D Cartesian and quasi-3D (in which the fields and current are decomposed into azimuthal harmonics) geometries. Illustrative results for laser wakefield accelerator simulation in a Lorentz boosted frame using the hybrid solver in the 2D Cartesian geometry are presented, and compared against results from 2D UPIC-EMMA simulation which uses a pure spectral Maxwell solver, and from OSIRIS 2D lab frame simulation using the standard Yee solver. Very good agreement is obtained which demonstrates the feasibility of using the hybrid solver for high fidelity simulation of relativistically drifting plasma with no evidence of the numerical Cerenkov instability.

abstract = {For many plasma physics problems, three-dimensional and kinetic effects are very important. However, such simulations are very computationally intensive. Fortunately, there is a class of problems for which there is nearly azimuthal symmetry and the dominant three-dimensional physics is captured by the inclusion of only a few azimuthal harmonics. Recently, it was proposed [1] to model one such problem, laser wakefield acceleration, by expanding the fields and currents in azimuthal harmonics and truncating the expansion. The complex amplitudes of the fundamental and first harmonic for the fields were solved on an r–z grid and a procedure for calculating the complex current amplitudes for each particle based on its motion in Cartesian geometry was presented using a Marder's correction to maintain the validity of Gauss's law. In this paper, we describe an implementation of this algorithm into OSIRIS using a rigorous charge conserving current deposition method to maintain the validity of Gauss's law. We show that this algorithm is a hybrid method which uses a particles-in-cell description in r–z and a gridless description in ϕ. We include the ability to keep an arbitrary number of harmonics and higher order particle shapes. Examples for laser wakefield acceleration, plasma wakefield acceleration, and beam loading are also presented and directions for future work are discussed.},

abstract = {Rapidly growing numerical instabilities routinely occur in multidimensional particle-in-cell computer simulations of plasma-based particle accelerators, astrophysical phenomena, and relativistic charged particle beams. Reducing instability growth to acceptable levels has necessitated higher resolution grids, high-order field solvers, current filtering, etc. except for certain ratios of the time step to the axial cell size, for which numerical growth rates and saturation levels are reduced substantially. This paper derives and solves the cold beam dispersion relation for numerical instabilities in multidimensional, relativistic, electromagnetic particle-in-cell programs employing either the standard or the Cole-Karkkainnen finite difference field solver on a staggered mesh and the common Esirkepov current-gathering algorithm. Good overall agreement is achieved with previously reported results of the WARP code. In particular, the existence of select time steps for which instabilities are minimized is explained. Additionally, an alternative field interpolation algorithm is proposed for which instabilities are almost completely eliminated for a particular time step in ultra-relativistic simulations. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract = {The perfectly matched layer (PML) has become a standard for comparison in the techniques that have been developed to close the system of Maxwell equations (more generally, wave equations) when simulating an open system. The original Berenger PMLformulation relies on a split version of Maxwell equations, with numerical elec- tric and magnetic conductivities. We present here an extension of this formulation, which introduces counterparts of the electric and magnetic conductivities affecting the term which is spatially differentiated in the equations. The phase velocity along each direction is also multiplied by an additional coefficient. We show that under certain constraints on the additional numerical coefficients, this “medium” does not generate any reflection at any angle or any frequency and is thus a perfectly matched layer. Technically it is a superset of Berenger'sPMLto which it reduces for a specific set of parameters, and like it, it is anisotropic.However, unlike the PML, it introduces some asymmetry in the absorption rate and is therefore labeled an APML, for asym- metric perfectly matched layer. We present here the numerical considerations that have led us to introduce such a medium as well as its theory. Several finite-difference numerical implementations are derived (in one, two, and three dimensions) and the performance of the APML is contrasted with that of the PML in one and two di- mensions. Using plane wave analysis, we show that our APML implementations lead to higher absorption rates than the considered PML implementations. Although we have considered in this paper the finite-difference discretization of Maxwell-like equations only, the APML system of equations may be used with other discretiza- tion schemes, such as finite elements, and may be applied to other equations, for applications beyond electromagnetics.},

For physical problems that have close-to-cylindrical symmetry, this algorithm can be much faster than full 3D PIC algorithms. In addition, unlike standard finite-difference PIC codes, the proposed algorithm is free of numerical dispersion. This algorithm is benchmarked in several situations that are of interest for laser-plasma interactions. These benchmarks show that it avoids a number of numerical artifacts, that would otherwise affect the physics in a standard PIC algorithm - including the zero-order numerical Cherenkov effect.},

@article{Yu2016,
abstract = {When modeling laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) using the particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm in a Lorentz boosted frame, the plasma is drifting relativistically at $\beta$bc towards the laser, which can lead to a computational speedup of ∼$\gamma$b2=(1−$\beta$b2)−1. Meanwhile, when LWFA is modeled in the quasi-3D geometry in which the electromagnetic fields and current are decomposed into a limited number of azimuthal harmonics, speedups are achieved by modeling three dimensional (3D) problems with the computational loads on the order of two dimensional r−z simulations. Here, we describe a method to combine the speed ups from the Lorentz boosted frame and quasi-3D algorithms. The key to the combination is the use of a hybrid Yee-FFT solver in the quasi-3D geometry that significantly mitigates the Numerical Cerenkov Instability (NCI) which inevitably arises in a Lorentz boosted frame due to the unphysical coupling of Langmuir modes and EM modes of the relativistically drifting plasma in these simulations. In addition, based on the space-time distribution of the LWFA data in the lab and boosted frame, we propose to use a moving window to follow the drifting plasma, instead of following the laser driver as in the LWFA lab frame simulation, in order to further reduce the computational loads. We describe the details of how the NCI is mitigated for the quasi-3D geometry, the setups for simulations which combine the Lorentz boosted frame, quasi-3D geometry, and the use of a moving window, and compare the results from these simulations against their corresponding lab frame cases. Good agreement is obtained among these sample simulations, particularly when there is no self-trapping, which demonstrates it is possible to combine the Lorentz boosted frame and the quasi-3D algorithms when modeling LWFA. We also discusse the preliminary speedups achieved in these sample simulations.},

abstract = {The Warp code (and its framework of associated tools) was initially developed for particle-in-cell simulations of space-charge-dominated ion beams in accelerators, for heavy-ion-driven inertial fusion energy, and related experiments. It has found a broad range of applications, including nonneutral plasmas in traps, stray electron clouds in accelerators, laser-based acceleration, and the focusing of ion beams produced when short-pulse lasers irradiate foil targets. We summarize novel methods used in Warp, including: time-stepping conducive to diagnosis and particle injection; an interactive Python-Fortran-C structure that enables scripted and interactive user steering of runs; a variety of geometries (3-D x, y, z; 2-D r, z; 2-D x, y); electrostatic and electromagnetic field solvers; a cut-cell representation for internal boundaries; the use of warped coordinates for bent beam lines; adaptive mesh refinement, including a capability for time-dependent space-charge-limited flow from curved surfaces; models for accelerator lattice elements (magnetic or electrostatic quadrupole lenses, accelerating gaps, etc.) at user-selectable levels of detail; models for particle interactions with gas and walls; moment/envelope models that support sophisticated particle loading; a drift-Lorentz mover for rapid tracking through regions of strong and weak magnetic field; a Lorentz-boosted frame formulation with a Lorentz-invariant modification of the Boris mover; an electromagnetic solver with tunable dispersion and stride-based digital filtering; and a pseudospectral electromagnetic solver. Warp has proven useful for a wide range of applications, described very briefly herein. It is available as an open-source code under a BSD license. This paper describes material presented during the Prof. Charles K. (Ned) Birdsall Memorial Session of the 2013 IEEE Pulsed Power and Plasma Science Conference. In addition to our overview of the computational methods used in Warp, we summarize a few asp- cts of Ned's contributions to plasma simulation and to the careers of those he mentored.},

With LCODE the evolution of the driver composed of several short particle bunches is studied. When properly positioned, the bunches are shown to achieve a radial equilibrium in which all driver particles are focused by the plasma, and the focusing force is balanced by driver transverse pressure. After establishment of the radial equilibrium, the driver loses much of its energy with little distortion in shape. Losing a major part of the initial energy, driver particles get defocused and lost. Due to this “self-cleaning,” the driver generates a good wake-field even after the particle loss of more than the half.},

abstract = {—A novel particle simulation code is described that self-consistently models certain classes of laser–plasma inter-actions without resolving the optical cycles of the laser. This is accomplished by separating the electromagnetic field into a laser component and a wake component. Although the wake component is treated as in a fully explicit particle-in-cell (PIC) code, the laser component is treated in the high-frequency limit, which allows the optical cycles to be averaged out. This leads to enormous reductions in computer time when the laser frequency is much greater than all other frequencies of interest. This work is an extension of the work of Mora and Antonsen, Jr. [1], [2], who derived the time-averaged equations coupling the laser with the particles and developed a code to solve these equations in the quasi-static limit. The code presented here is distinguished by the fact that it is useful when the plasma length is much less than the laser pulse length. Also, it is already parallelized and should be straightforward to extend to three dimensions.},

@article{YuCPC2015,
abstract = {When using an electromagnetic particle-in-cell (EM-PIC) code to simulate a relativistically drifting plasma, a violent numerical instability known as the numerical Cerenkov instability (NCI) occurs. The NCI is due to the unphysical coupling of electromagnetic waves on a grid to wave-particle resonances, including aliased resonances, i.e., omega + 2 pi mu/Delta t = (k(1) + 2 pi v(1)/Delta x(1))nu(0), where mu and v(1) refer to the time and space aliases and the plasma is drifting relativistically at velocity nu(0) in the (1) over cap -direction. We extend our previous work Xu et al. (2013) by recasting the numerical dispersion relation of a relativistically drifting plasma into a form which shows explicitly how the instability results from the coupling modes which are-purely-transverse electromagnetic (EM) modes-and purely longitudinal modes in-the rest frame of the plasma for each time and space aliasing. The dispersion relation for each mu and v(1) is the product of the dispersion relation of these two modes set equal to a coupling term that vanishes in the continuous limit. The new form of the numerical dispersion relation provides an accurate method of systematically calculating the growth rate and location of the mode in the fundamental Brillouin zone for any Maxwell solver for each mu, and v(1). We then focus on the spectral Maxwell solver and systematically discuss its NCI modes. We show that the second fastest growing NCI mode for the spectral solver corresponds to mu = v(1) = 0, that it has a growth rate approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the fastest growing mu = 0 and v(1) = 1 mode, and that its location in the k space fundamental Brillouin zone is sensitive to the grid size and time step. Based on these studies, strategies to systematically eliminate the NCI modes for a spectral solver are developed. We apply these strategies to both relativistic collisionless shock and LWFA simulations, and demonstrate that high-fidelity multi-dimensional simulations of drifting plasmas can be carried out with a spectral Maxwell solver with no evidence of numerical Cerenkov instability.

abstract = {We propose a spectral Particle-In-Cell (PIC) algorithm that is based on the combination of a Hankel transform and a Fourier transform. For physical problems that have close-to-cylindrical symmetry, this algorithm can be much faster than full 3D PIC algorithms. In addition, unlike standard finite-difference PIC codes, the proposed algorithm is free of spurious numerical dispersion, in vacuum. This algorithm is benchmarked in several situations that are of interest for laser–plasma interactions. These benchmarks show that it avoids a number of numerical artifacts, that would otherwise affect the physics in a standard PIC algorithm — including the zero-order numerical Cherenkov effect.},

abstract = {The Warp code, developed for heavy‐ion driven inertial fusion energy studies, is used to model high intensity ion (and electron) beams. Significant capability has been incorporated in Warp, allowing nearly all sections of an accelerator to be modeled, beginning with the source. Warp has as its core an explicit, three‐dimensional, particle‐in‐cell model. Alongside this is a rich set of tools for describing the applied fields of the accelerator lattice, and embedded conducting surfaces (which are captured at sub‐grid resolution). Also incorporated are models with reduced dimensionality: an axisymmetric model and a transverse “slice” model. The code takes advantage of modern programming techniques, including object orientation, parallelism, and scripting (via Python). It is at the forefront in the use of the computational technique of adaptive mesh refinement, which has been particularly successful in the area of diode and injector modeling, both steady‐state and time‐dependent. In the presentation, some of the major aspects of Warp will be overviewed, especially those that could be useful in modeling ECR sources. Warp has been benchmarked against both theory and experiment. Recent results will be presented showing good agreement of Warp with experimental results from the STS500 injector test stand.

abstract = {Very high order or pseudo-spectral Maxwell solvers are the method of choice to reduce discretization effects (e.g. numerical dispersion) that are inherent to low order Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) schemes. However, due to their large stencils, these solvers are often subject to truncation errors in many electromagnetic simulations. These truncation errors come from non-physical modifications of Maxwell's equations in space that may generate spurious signals affecting the overall accuracy of the simulation results. Such modifications for instance occur when Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) are used at simulation domain boundaries to simulate open media. Another example is the use of arbitrary order Maxwell solver with domain decomposition technique that may under some condition involve stencil truncations at subdomain boundaries, resulting in small spurious errors that do eventually build up. In each case, a careful evaluation of the characteristics and magnitude of the errors resulting from these approximations, and their impact at any frequency and angle, requires detailed analytical and numerical studies. To this end, we present a general analytical approach that enables the evaluation of numerical errors of fully three-dimensional arbitrary order finite-difference Maxwell solver, with arbitrary modification of the local stencil in the simulation domain. The analytical model is validated against simulations of domain decomposition technique and PMLs, when these are used with very high order Maxwell solver, as well as in the infinite order limit of pseudo-spectral solvers. Results confirm that the new analytical approach enables exact predictions in each case. It also confirms that the domain decomposition technique can be used with very high-order Maxwell solvers and a reasonably low number of guard cells with negligible effects on the whole accuracy of the simulation.

abstract = {A procedure for largely suppressing the numerical Cherenkov instability in finite difference time-domain (FDTD) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of cold, relativistic beams is derived, and residual growth rates computed and compared with WARP code simulation results. Sample laser-plasma acceleration simulation output is provided to further validate the new procedure.},
