WarpX is a Particle-In-Cell code with several advanced features (e.g. mesh
refinement and PML). This page contains a summary of the theoretical background
for these features. For a more generic description of the
Particle-In-Cell algorithm, see the
`PICSAR documentation <../../../../../picsar/Doxygen/html/_theory.html>`_.
