WarpX documentation
===================

WarpX is an advanced electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell code. It supports many
features including Perfectly-Matched Layers (PML) and **mesh refinement**.
For details on the algorithms that WarpX implements, see the section :doc:`theory/theory`.

In addition, WarpX is a highly-parallel and highly-optimized code
and features hybrid OpenMP/MPI parallelization, advanced vectorization
techniques and load balancing capabilities.
