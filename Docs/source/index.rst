WarpX documentation
===================

.. warning::

   This is an **alpha release** of WarpX.
   The code is still in active development.
   Robustness and performance may fluctuate at this stage.
   The input and output formats may evolve.

WarpX is an advanced **electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell** code.

It supports many features including:

    - Perfectly-Matched Layers (PML)
    - Boosted-frame simulations
    - Mesh refinement

For details on the algorithms that WarpX implements, see the section :doc:`theory/theory`.

In addition, WarpX is a highly-parallel and highly-optimized code
and features hybrid OpenMP/MPI parallelization, advanced vectorization
techniques and load balancing capabilities.
