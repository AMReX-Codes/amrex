Installation
============

Downloading the code
--------------------

You should clone the source codes of AMReX, PICSAR and WarpX into one
single directory (e.g. ``warpx_directory``):

::

    mkdir warpx_directory
    cd warpx_directory
    git clone https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/warpx.git
    git clone https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/picsar.git
    git clone https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex.git

You should then switch to the branch ``development`` of AMReX

::

    cd amrex/
    git checkout development
    cd ..

Compiling WarpX as an executable
--------------------------------

Generic instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``cd`` into the directory ``warpx`` and type

::

    make -j 4

This will generate an executable file in the ``Bin`` directory.

.. note::

    The compilation options are set in the file ``GNUmakefile``. The default
    options correspond to an optimized code for 3D geometry. You can modify the
    options in this file in order to (for instance):

        * Use 2D geometry
        * Disable OpenMP
        * Profile or debug the code
        * Choose a given compiler

    For a description of these different options, see the `corresponding page
    <https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/BuildingAMReX.html#building-with-gnu-make>`__ in
    the AMReX documentation.

    Alternatively, instead of modifying the file ``GNUmakefile``, you can
    directly pass the options in command line ; for instance:

    ::

        make -j 4 USE_OMP=FALSE

In order to clean a previously compiled version:

::

    make realclean

In order to learn how to use the executable, see the section :doc:`running_cpp/running_cpp`.

Compiling with a spectral solver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the code is compiled with a finite-difference (FDTD) Maxwell solver.
In order to run the code with a spectral solver, you need to:

      - Install (or load) an MPI-enabled version of FFTW.
        For instance, for Debian, this can be done with
        ::
           
           apt-get install libfftw3-dev libfftw3-mpi-dev
           
      - Set the environment variable ``FFTW_HOME`` to the path for FFTW.
        For instance, for Debian, this is done with
        ::
           
           export FFTW_HOME=/usr/
           
      - Set ``USE_PSATD=TRUE`` when compiling:
        ::
           
           make -j 4 USE_PSATD=TRUE


Compiling WarpX as a Python package
-----------------------------------

``cd`` into the directory ``warpx/Python`` (instead of ``warpx``
in the previous section) and type

::

    make -j 4

This will compile the code, and install the Python bindings as a package (named
``pywarpx``) in your standard Python installation (i.e. in your
``site-packages`` directory). The note on compiler options from the previous
section also hold when compiling the Python package.

In case you do not have write permissions to the default Python installation (e.g. typical on computer clusters), use the following command instead:

::

   make -j 4 PYINSTALLOPTIONS=--user
In this case, you can also set the variable `PYTHONUSERBASE` to set the folder where `pywarpx` will be installed.


In order to learn how to use the Python package, see the section :doc:`running_python/running_python`.


Compiling WarpX for Cori
------------------------

For the `Cori cluster
<http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/cori/>`__ at NERSC,
you need to type the following command when compiling:

.. note::

   In order to compile the code with a spectral solver, type

   ::

	module load cray-fftw

   before typing any of the commands below, and add ``USE_PSATD=TRUE``
   at the end of the command containing ``make``.

In order to compile for the **Haswell architecture**:

    * with the Intel compiler

    ::

        make -j 16 COMP=intel

    * with the GNU compiler

    ::

        module swap PrgEnv-intel PrgEnv-gnu
        make -j 16 COMP=gnu

In order to compile for the **Knight's Landing (KNL) architecture**:

    * with the Intel compiler

    ::

        module swap craype-haswell craype-mic-knl
        make -j 16 COMP=intel

    * with the GNU compiler

    ::

        module swap craype-haswell craype-mic-knl
        module swap PrgEnv-intel PrgEnv-gnu
        make -j 16 COMP=gnu
