AMReX Tutorials
===============

AMReX is a software framework library containing all the functionality to write
massively parallel, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications. AMReX is freely available at https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex.

There is extensive documentation for AMReX at :ref:`amrex_docs:amrex_doc_indx`

AMReX Tutorials are a set of small stand-alone example codes that demonstrate how
to use different parts of the AMReX functionality.  

We are always happy to have users contribute to AMReX Tutorials as well as 
the AMReX source code. To contribute, issue a pull request against the development branch 
(details at https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
