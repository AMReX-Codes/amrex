Tutorials/GPU
==========================

The tutorials in ``amrex/Tutorials/GPU`` demonstrate the implementation
of AMReX's GPU toolkit as well as provide GPU ported versions of CPU
tutorials to help applications convert to GPUs. 

**Your first AMReX GPU application**
------------------------------------

This is a step-by-step guide to preparing, compiling and running your first
AMReX GPU program.  This guide will use ``Tutorials/GPU/Launch``,
and instructions will focus on ORNL's systems:

1. Before compiling, the ``pgi`` and ``cuda`` software must be available. 
   On ORNL systems, the modules can be loaded directly by typing:

.. highlight:: console

::

   module load pgi cuda

2. Go to ``Tutorials/GPU/Launch`` to compile the executable.  Compile with
   ``make USE_CUDA=TRUE COMP=pgi USE_MPI=TRUE USE_OMP=FALSE``, or edit the
   ``GNUmakefile`` to match this configuration and run ``make``. This
   should result in an executable: ``main3d.pgi.MPI.CUDA.ex``.  

3. On Summit systems, this executable can be submitted by using one of the run
   scripts found in ``Tutorials/GPU``.  ``run.script`` can be used to run on
   Summitdev, and ``run.summit`` can be used for Summit.  To change the number
   of ranks and GPUs used in the simulation, change the number of resource sets,
   ``n`` in the ``jsrun`` line.  For the first ``Launch`` tutorial, use ``n=1``
   and set ``INPUTS=""`` because no input file is used in this example. 

When ready, submit the job script (on Summit: ``bsub run.script``).
Congratulations! You've accelerated AMReX using GPUs! 

**Launch**
----------

Launch shows multiple examples of how GPU work can be offloaded using the tools
available in AMReX. It includes examples of multiple AMReX macro launch methods,
launching a Fortran function using CUDA and launching work using OpenACC and 
OpenMP offloading. This tutorial will be regularly updated with AMReX's 
preferred GPU launch methodologies.

**CNS**
-------

CNS is a direct GPU port of the ``Tutorials/EB/CNS`` tutorial.

**AmrCore**
-----------

AmrCore is a direct GPU port of the ``Tutorials/Amr/Advection_AmrCore`` tutorial
that advects a single scalar field with a velocity field specified on faces, using
strategies similar to HeatEquation and CNS.
