AMReX Introduction
===================

AMReX is a publicly available software framework designed for
building massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) applications.

Key features of AMReX include:

-  C++ and Fortran interfaces

-  1-, 2- and 3-D support

-  Support for cell-centered, face-centered, edge-centered, and
   nodal data

-  Support for hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic solves on
   hierarchical adaptive grid structure

-  Optional subcycling in time for time-dependent PDEs

-  Support for particles

-  Parallelization via flat MPI, OpenMP, hybrid MPI/OpenMP, or MPI/MPI

-  Parallel I/O

-  Plotfile format supported by AmrVis, VisIt, Paraview, and yt.

Because AMReX’s core is mainly written in C++, the basics of AMReX is first introduced in C++.
The available Fortran wrappers will then be described as well.

Besides the User’s Guide, there is documentation generated by Doxygen at
https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/doxygen. 
Documentation on migration from BoxLib is available at Docs/Migration.
