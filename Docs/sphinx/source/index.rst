Welcome to AMReX's documentation
================================

AMReX is a software framework library containing all the functionality to write
massively parallel, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications. AMReX is freely available at
https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex.

AMReX is developed at LBNL, NREL, and ANL as part of the Block-Structured AMR
Co-Design Center in DOE's Exascale Computing Project. 

All of AMReX's development is done in the github repository under the
development branch; anyone can see the latest updates. Changes are merged into
the master branch at the beginning of each month.

We are always happy to have users contribute to the AMReX source code. To
contribute, issue a pull request against the development branch (details at
https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).  Any level of
changes are welcomed: documentation, bug fixes, new test problems, new solvers,
...

To obtain help, simply post an issue in the AMReX GitHub webpage at
