\amrex\ is a publicly available software framework designed for
building massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) applications.

Key features of \amrex\ include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \cpp\ and Fortran interfaces
\item 1-, 2- and 3-D support
\item Support for cell-centered, face-centered, edge-centered, and
  nodal data
\item Support for hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic solves on
  hierarchical adaptive grid structure
\item Optional subcycling in time for time-dependent PDEs
\item Support for particles
\item Parallelization via flat MPI, OpenMP, hybrid MPI/OpenMP, or MPI/MPI
\item Parallel I/O
\item Plotfile format supported by \amrvis, \visit, \paraview, and \yt.
\end{itemize}

Because \amrex's core is mainly written in \cpp, the basics of \amrex\
is first introduced in \cpp\ and then their Fortran wrappers if
available will be described as well.  

Besides the User's Guide, there is document generated by Doxygen at
\url{https://ccse.lbl.gov/pub/AMReX_Docs/}.  Documentation on
migration from \boxlib\ is available at {\tt Docs/Migration}.
