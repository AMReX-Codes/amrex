(***) We no longer edit the latex at all -- we edit the .rst files in amrex/Docs/sphinx/source in the *development* branch

To update the online AMReX documentation using sphinx:

      1. Checkout the development branch of AMReX

      2. Go to amrex/Docs/sphinx/source and edit the relevant .rst file(s).

      3. Commit your changes.

The TravisCI script will build the html pages and commit them to AMReX's gh-pages branch for you. If you would like to
preview the html locally, you can:

        4. Go back into amrex/Docs/sphinx.

        5. Type "make html".  This will build new html files in amrex/Docs/sphinx/build/html

**********************************************************************************

If you would like to build the web pages locally, you will need Python, the Sphinx software, and the "Read the Docs" theme. 

If you have conda, you can install the necessary packages as follows:

       1. Type "conda install sphinx"

       2. Type "conda install sphinx_rtd_theme"

If you don't have a conda Python installation, you get one by doing the following:

       1.  Go to https://conda.io/miniconda.html and download the Python 3.6 64-bit (bash installer), "Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh".  Save this script to your hard drive.

       2.  Type "bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh" and follow the installation prompts.

       3.  The install script will prompt you to add some commands to your .bashrc that add the miniconda install location to your PATH environment variable.
           If Bash is your default shell, choose "yes". Otherwise, you will need to manually do the same for your shell of choice. 

       4.  Either open a new terminal, or re-source the configuration file you just added to. E.g., for bash:
                  source ~/.bashrc

You should now be able to successfully "make html" in amrex/Docs/sphinx.

If you would like to make a pdf document from the *rst files, first 

sudo apt-get install latexmk
(if you are using macOS, latexmk is installed via the TexLive Utility)

Then in the amrex/Docs/sphinx directory, type 

make latexpdf
(if you have the slimmed-down latex install, then you need to also install the following packages via TexLive Utility: tabulary, varwidth, framed, wrapfig, capt-of, needspace, courier)


This will create amrex/Docs/sphinx/build/latex/amrex.pdf
