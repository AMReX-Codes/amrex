# 20.09

  -- Fix interpolation coefficients for EB stencil in cell-centered linear
     solvers when the EB surface at the domain boundary is tilted.

  -- Add a parameter to `AMReX_omp_mod` that can be used by Fortran code to
     check whether AMReX was built with OpenMP support, and, if yes, what
     the version number (_OPENMP) was at the time AMReX was compiled.

  -- CMake: re-write genex evaluation functions.

  -- Extend the number of unique particles per cpu we can have at once.

  -- Add a new method to the `amrex_distromap` type in

     no longer being maintained.

  -- Switch the overset mask convention to that 1 means unknown and 0 means
     known.  The new convention is more convenient for AMR-Wind.

  -- Remove old solvers, Src/LinearSolvers/C_CellMG and C_TensorMG.  They

  -- Turn tiling off by default for gpu.

# 20.06

  -- Set a non-default CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX only if AMReX is the
     top-level CMake project. Otherwise, the default of a downstream
     project using AMReX as subproject will be placed in a quite
     confusing, temporary directory.

  -- Disable unqualified abs function within amrex namespace.

     addition to MultiFab.

  -- Fix -pthread for nvcc by default in Make.unknown

# 19.07

  -- Geometry/CoordSys: Static class members have been removed.
     Functions such as `isPeriodic`, `isAnyPeriodic`, `isAllPeriodic`,
     `ProbLo`, `ProbHi`, `IsCartesian`, `IsRZ`, and `IsSPHERICAL` are
     now non-static.  The default Geometry can been obtained via

# 19.06

     We plan to remove static data from Geometry and its base CoordSys
     in the next release.  This means most of the static functions in
     Geometry class will become non-static.  These include
     `isPeriodic`, `isAnyPeriodic`, `isAllPeriodic`, `ProbLo`,
     `ProbHi`, `IsCartesian`, `IsRZ`, and `IsSPHERICAL`.  You can
     prepare codes now for the upcoming changes.  In almost all cases,
     all you have to do is replace `Geometry::function` with
     `DefaultGeometry().function`.

  -- Add tensor linear solvers for viscous flows with and without EB.

  -- Algoim: A modified version of Algoim is added.  This removes the

  -- Add a trilinear interpolation option for 3D.

     to C++ (F_Interfaces) are still there.

  -- In addition to launch macros, there are now functions for
     lauching, amrex::launch, amrex::For and amrex::ParallelFor.
     These improves debuggability. 

  -- If compiled with BASEFAB_IS_PINNED, pinned memory will be used
     for BaseFab meta-data.  On systems with nvlink, this improves the

  -- Faster geometry generation is available at Src/EB2.
     Tutorials/EB/CNS is now based on EB2.

     for an example.

# 18.07

  -- Pre- and post-interpolation hooks in FillPatch.

  -- NDEBUG is no longer defined in xSDK mode.

# 18.06

  -- When amrex::Initialize is called, optional std::ostream arguments
     can be passed in and their defaults are std::cout and std::cerr.

  -- ParmParse inputs files can now contain Fortran namelist that can
     be accessed from Fortan (and Frotran only).  These Fortran inputs
     are stored in amrex_namelist character variable in
     amrex_parmparse_module, and can be read with standard Fortran
     I/O.
     
  -- There is a new non-blocking parallel copy function in
     MultiFab/FabArray called ParallelCopy_nowait.  It returns a
     CopierHandle object and can later be used to finish the
     communication with CopierHandle::finish().

# 18.05

  -- FillBoundary and ParallelCopy functions can now take IntVect
     arguments as the number of ghost cells.  That is the number of
     ghost cells could be different for different directions.

  -- MultiFab, iMultiFab and FabArray can have different number of
     ghost cells in different directions.

  -- Fortran module mempool_module has been renamed amrex_mempool_module.

     single Box.

  -- Optimization of particle redistribution

  -- MLMG nodal linear solver: add solvability fix

  -- STL support for EB

# 18.02

  -- Fortran interface: added new functions amrex_multifab_build_alias
     and amrex_imultifab_build_alias.

  -- Documentation in reST/Sphinx.  See Docs/Readme.sphinx for more
     details.

  -- Src/LinearSolvers/MLMG now supports nodal based data.

  -- Fortran module AMReX_fillpatch_module takes a user provided
     callback function for filling physical boundary conditions.  That
     function used to use 0-based index for component (i.e., the last
     index).  For consistence with 1-based index for component in
     other Fortran modules, this has been changed to 1-based index for
     component.

# 18.01

  -- New linear solver MLMG at Src/LinearSolvers/MLMG/.  Currently it
     supports cell-centered single level and multi-level composite
     solve.  Fortran interface is also available at
     Src/F_Interfaces/LinearSolvers/.  See Tutorials/LinearSolvers for
     tutorials.

# 17.12

  -- Ported more features (including dynamic scheduling and explicit
     tile size) of MFIter from C++ to Fortran.

  -- Added procedures to Fortran amrex_multifab_module to add,
     subtract, multiply, divide, saxpy and lincomb (linear
     combination).  Note that we call it saxpy, but it doesn't mean
     single precision.

  -- The `configure; make; make install` build approach enables linear
     solvers by default now.

  -- MultiFab and iMultiFab now support move assignment operator.
     This allows for swapping two MultiFabs without deep copying.  For
     instance, std::swap(mf1, mf2);

  -- Tutorials/Amr/Advection_AmrCore changes from using
     `Vector<unique_ptr<MultiFab>>` to `Vector<MultiFab>`.

# 17.11

  -- AMREX_ASSERT_WITH_MESSAGE and AMREX_ALWAYS_ASSERT_WITH_MESSAGE
     are new macros for assertion when it fails additional message
     will be printed.   For example:

         AMREX_ASSERT_WITH_MESSAGE(x > y, "reason why x > y must be true");

  -- amrex::Array is deprecated and replaced by amrex::Vector.
     Currently Array is an alias to Vector.  So this should not break
     any codes.  In the future, we will remove Array completely.
     Therefore it is recommended that application codes should start
     replacing Array with Vector.  There is a script,
     amrex/Tools/Migration/amrex_array_to_vector.sh, to help.  But use
     it with caution.   If it is completely gibberish to you, you
     probably shouldn't use the script. 

  -- functions for printing to a file in a parallel and thread-safe manner
     have been added. For example:

        amrex::AllPrintToFile("output") << "Hello from rank " << rank << 
                                           " and thread " << thread << "\n";

     will print out the requested information to separate files for each 
     rank and thread.

# 17.10

  -- Added a load balance approach to Amr/AmrLevel.  The runtime
     parameters for this is amr.loadbalance_with_workestimates and
     amr.loadbalance_level0_int.  The latter is for single level
     (i.e., amr.max_level=0) only.  For multi-level runs, load balance
     is done during regrid and thus the load balance interval is
     controlled by amr.regrid_int.  To use this approach, AmrLevel
     derivative must has a StateData for work estimates and its index
     is returned by virtual function int WorkEstType().

  -- MFIter now supports dynamic scheduling of OpenMP threads.  For
     example,
 
       for (MFIter mfi(mf, MFItInfo().SetDynamic(true).EnableTiling(tile_size);
            mfi.isValid(); ++mfi)
       { ... }

  -- Added EBFluxRegister to Src/EB for refluxing and
     re-redistribution in EB.

  -- amrex.signal_handling = 1 is a new runtime parameter that can be
     used to control whether AMReX should handle signals like SIGSEGV
     etc.
