# 19.05

  -- Interface of virtual function Interpolater::interp has changed.

  -- Add Fortran funcntions for shared memory reductions.

  -- EB nodal linear solver: The default bottom solver is now bicgcg.
     It starts with bicgstab and switches cg if bicgstab fails.

  -- EB nodal linear solver: Finished the implementation of matrix
     coarsening with RAP.

  -- Particle: Option for adding runtime struct of array components.

  -- Add a trilinear interpolation option for 3D.

  -- Add more support for non-uniform grow vectors to MultiFab and
     FabArray.

  -- AmrMesh: n_error_buf is now IntVect.  This allows for different
     number of error buffer cells in different directions.

  -- Using PETSc as bottom solver no longer requires Hypre.
 
# 19.04

  -- SUNDIALS 4 support.

  -- Option to disable device sync in MFIter.

  -- Functions for prefetch unified memory.

  -- GNU Make system: It is now an error if a function with return
     type does not return.

  -- GNU Make system: Pass C++ flags to nvcc when compiling C codes.

  -- Allocate 3/4 of gpu memory upfront in The_Arena.

  -- BaseFab now has Allocator template parameter.

  -- Random number generation on gpu.

# 19.03

  -- Deprecated Fortran framework F_BaseLib and linear solver F_MG
     have been removed.  A number of tools written in F_BaseLib have
     been migrated to Tools/Plotfile/.  Note that the Fortran wrappers
     to C++ (F_Interfaces) are still there.

  -- In addition to launch macros, there are now functions for
     lauching, amrex::launch, amrex::For and amrex::ParallelFor.
     These improves debuggability. 

  -- If compiled with BASEFAB_IS_PINNED, pinned memory will be used
     for BaseFab meta-data.  On systems with nvlink, this improves the
     performance a little bit.

  -- Performance improvement in particle redistribution.

  -- Particle NeighborList has been moved from tutorial to AMReX
     proper.

  -- Cell-centered MLMG linear solver have been ported to GPU.

# 19.02

  -- Array4 class that contains the important information in BaseFab
     class.  It can be captured by lambda and used on gpu.

  -- A number of new macros for launching for loops: AMREX_FOR_1D,
     AMREX_FOR_3D, AMREX_FOR_4D, AMREX_PARALLEL_FOR_1D,
     AMREX_PARALLEL_FOR_3D, and AMREX_PARALLEL_FOR_4D.

  -- Disable cuda aware MPI by default.  It can be enabled with
     parameter amrex.use_gpu_aware_mpi.

# 19.01

  -- Documentation and Tutorials on GPU

  -- EB implicit function using spline

  -- FabArray::fabPtr() function takes MFIter and returns a device
     pointer to BaseFab.

  -- Cell-centered linear solver with homogeneous Neumann embedded
     boundary. 

  -- Hypre as a bottom solver has a IJ matrix interface and supports
     homogeneous Neumann boundary condition on embedded boundary.

  -- Old embedded boundary codes have been removed.

# 18.08

  -- Faster geometry generation is available at Src/EB2.
     Tutorials/EB/CNS is now based on EB2.

  -- AMReX is now fully compliant with xSDK.

  -- Fortran interface for particles.  See Tutorials/Amr/Advection_F/
     for an example.

# 18.07

  -- Pre- and post-interpolation hooks in FillPatch.

  -- NDEBUG is no longer defined in xSDK mode.

# 18.06

  -- When amrex::Initialize is called, optional std::ostream arguments
     can be passed in and their defaults are std::cout and std::cerr.

  -- ParmParse inputs files can now contain Fortran namelist that can
     be accessed from Fortan (and Frotran only).  These Fortran inputs
     are stored in amrex_namelist character variable in
     amrex_parmparse_module, and can be read with standard Fortran
     I/O.
     
  -- There is a new non-blocking parallel copy function in
     MultiFab/FabArray called ParallelCopy_nowait.  It returns a
     CopierHandle object and can later be used to finish the
     communication with CopierHandle::finish().

# 18.05

  -- FillBoundary and ParallelCopy functions can now take IntVect
     arguments as the number of ghost cells.  That is the number of
     ghost cells could be different for different directions.

  -- MultiFab, iMultiFab and FabArray can have different number of
     ghost cells in different directions.

  -- Fortran module mempool_module has been renamed amrex_mempool_module.

  -- Many macros have been renamed.
     * USE_PARTICLES and PARTICLES have been renamed AMREX_PARTICLES
     * DIMENSION_AGNOSTIC has been renamed AMREX_DIMENSION_AGNOSTIC
     * USE_CVODE has been renamed AMREX_USE_CVODE
     * DEBUG has been renamed AMREX_DEBUG

 -- amrex::Array is now an alias to std::array in stead of amrex::Vector.

# 18.04

  -- New BoxList constructors making a given number of Boxes from a
     single Box.

  -- Optimization of particle redistribution

  -- MLMG nodal linear solver: add solvability fix

  -- Modification to amrex::Initialize and Finalize to make it
     suitable as a library in an application that does not use AMReX
     as a framework.

# 18.03

  -- STL support for EB

# 18.02

  -- Fortran interface: added new functions amrex_multifab_build_alias
     and amrex_imultifab_build_alias.

  -- Documentation in reST/Sphinx.  See Docs/Readme.sphinx for more
     details.

  -- Src/LinearSolvers/MLMG now supports nodal based data.

  -- Fortran module AMReX_fillpatch_module takes a user provided
     callback function for filling physical boundary conditions.  That
     function used to use 0-based index for component (i.e., the last
     index).  For consistence with 1-based index for component in
     other Fortran modules, this has been changed to 1-based index for
     component.

# 18.01

  -- New linear solver MLMG at Src/LinearSolvers/MLMG/.  Currently it
     supports cell-centered single level and multi-level composite
     solve.  Fortran interface is also available at
     Src/F_Interfaces/LinearSolvers/.  See Tutorials/LinearSolvers for
     tutorials.

# 17.12

  -- Ported more features (including dynamic scheduling and explicit
     tile size) of MFIter from C++ to Fortran.

  -- Added procedures to Fortran amrex_multifab_module to add,
     subtract, multiply, divide, saxpy and lincomb (linear
     combination).  Note that we call it saxpy, but it doesn't mean
     single precision.

  -- The `configure; make; make install` build approach enables linear
     solvers by default now.

  -- MultiFab and iMultiFab now support move assignment operator.
     This allows for swapping two MultiFabs without deep copying.  For
     instance, std::swap(mf1, mf2);

  -- Tutorials/Amr/Advection_AmrCore changes from using
     `Vector<unique_ptr<MultiFab>>` to `Vector<MultiFab>`.

# 17.11

  -- AMREX_ASSERT_WITH_MESSAGE and AMREX_ALWAYS_ASSERT_WITH_MESSAGE
     are new macros for assertion when it fails additional message
     will be printed.   For example:

         AMREX_ASSERT_WITH_MESSAGE(x > y, "reason why x > y must be true");

  -- amrex::Array is deprecated and replaced by amrex::Vector.
     Currently Array is an alias to Vector.  So this should not break
     any codes.  In the future, we will remove Array completely.
     Therefore it is recommended that application codes should start
     replacing Array with Vector.  There is a script,
     amrex/Tools/Migration/amrex_array_to_vector.sh, to help.  But use
     it with caution.   If it is completely gibberish to you, you
     probably shouldn't use the script. 

  -- functions for printing to a file in a parallel and thread-safe manner
     have been added. For example:

        amrex::AllPrintToFile("output") << "Hello from rank " << rank << 
                                           " and thread " << thread << "\n";

     will print out the requested information to separate files for each 
     rank and thread.

# 17.10

  -- Added a load balance approach to Amr/AmrLevel.  The runtime
     parameters for this is amr.loadbalance_with_workestimates and
     amr.loadbalance_level0_int.  The latter is for single level
     (i.e., amr.max_level=0) only.  For multi-level runs, load balance
     is done during regrid and thus the load balance interval is
     controlled by amr.regrid_int.  To use this approach, AmrLevel
     derivative must has a StateData for work estimates and its index
     is returned by virtual function int WorkEstType().

  -- MFIter now supports dynamic scheduling of OpenMP threads.  For
     example,
 
       for (MFIter mfi(mf, MFItInfo().SetDynamic(true).EnableTiling(tile_size);
            mfi.isValid(); ++mfi)
       { ... }

  -- Added EBFluxRegister to Src/EB for refluxing and
     re-redistribution in EB.

  -- amrex.signal_handling = 1 is a new runtime parameter that can be
     used to control whether AMReX should handle signals like SIGSEGV
     etc.
