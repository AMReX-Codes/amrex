# changes since the last release

  -- amrex::Array is deprecated and replaced by amrex::Vector.
     Currently Array is an alias to Vector.  So this should not break
     any codes.  In the future, we will remove Array completely.
     Therefore it is recommended that application codes should start
     replacing Array with Vector.  There is a script,
     amrex/Tools/Migration/amrex_array_to_vector.sh, to help.  But use
     it with caution.   If it is completely gibberish to you, you
     probably shouldn't use the script. 

  -- functions for printing to a file in a parallel and thread-safe manner
     have been added. For example:

        amrex::AllPrintToFile("output") << "Hello from rank " << rank << 
                                           " and thread " << thread << "\n";

     will print out the requested information to separate files for each 
     rank and thread.

# 17.10

  -- Added a load balance approach to Amr/AmrLevel.  The runtime
     parameters for this is amr.loadbalance_with_workestimates and
     amr.loadbalance_level0_int.  The latter is for single level
     (i.e., amr.max_level=0) only.  For multi-level runs, load balance
     is done during regrid and thus the load balance interval is
     controlled by amr.regrid_int.  To use this approach, AmrLevel
     derivative must has a StateData for work estimates and its index
     is returned by virtual function int WorkEstType().

  -- MFIter now supports dynamic scheduling of OpenMP threads.  For
     example,
 
       for (MFIter mfi(mf, MFItInfo().SetDynamic(true).EnableTiling(tile_size);
            mfi.isValid(); ++mfi)
       { ... }

  -- Added EBFluxRegister to Src/EB for refluxing and
     re-redistribution in EB.

  -- amrex.signal_handling = 1 is a new runtime parameter that can be
     used to control whether AMReX should handle signals like SIGSEGV
     etc.
