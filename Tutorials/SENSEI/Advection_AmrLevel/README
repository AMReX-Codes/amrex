Advection_AmrLevel: This tutorial contains an AMR advection code that advects a single 
scalar field with a velocity field that is specified on faces.

It is an AMReX based code designed to run in parallel using MPI/OMP.

This example uses source code from the amrex/Src/Base, Boundary, AmrCore , and
Amr directories.

The directories Exec/SingleVortex and Exec/UniformVelocity each include 
a makefile and a sample inputs file.  
Plotfiles are generated that can be viewed with amrvis2d / amrvis3d
(CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool, downloadable separately from ccse.lbl.gov)
or with VisIt.
