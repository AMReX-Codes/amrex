Advection_AmrCore: This tutorial contains an AMR advection code that advects a single 
scalar field with a velocity field that is specified on faces.

It is an AMReX based code designed to run in parallel using MPI/OMP.

This example uses source code from the amrex/Src/Base, Boundary, and AmrCore directories.
Notably, this example does not use source code from amrex/Src/Amr
(see the tutorial Advection_AmrLevel).

The directory Exec/SingleVortex includes a makefile and a sample inputs file.  
Plotfiles are generated that can be viewed with amrvis2d / amrvis3d
(CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool, downloadable separately from ccse.lbl.gov)
or with VisIt.
