Advection_Helmholtz_F: The features of this code are

1. Multicomponent advection - Advects a specified number of scalar fields with a velocity field that is specified on faces with Neumann BC. The number of components is taken as an input - ncomp from the input file. The initial conditions for the components can be specified in Prob.f90.

2. Helmholtz solver with Neumann BC integrated within the time loop. The Helmholtz problem (same as in LinearSolvers/ABecLaplacian_F) is constructed on the adapted grid and solved for within the time loop.

3. Works in both 2d and 3d. make DIM=2 or DIM=3 to compile.

4. Can be used as a starting template for CFD solvers.
 
It is a AMReX based code designed to run in parallel using MPI.
It uses the Fortran interfaces of AMReX.
