This Tutorial demonstrates how to call the SWFFT wrapper to the FFTW3 solver.

In this test case we set up a right hand side (rhs), call the forward transform and output the solution, 
then call the backward solver and output the returned field which is identical to the original rhs.

To build the code, type 'make' in this directory.

To run the code, type 'main3d.gnu.MPI.ex inputs' in this directory

To visualize the output, you can use amrvis3d (source available at https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/Amrvis):

amrvis3d -mf RHS_BEFORE
amrvis3d -mf RHS_AFTER
amrvis3d -mf SOLN
