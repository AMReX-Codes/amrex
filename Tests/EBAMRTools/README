regression/ebcoarseAveTest does a convergence test on conservative restriction.
regression/ebcoarseAveTestFace does a simple test for face averaging.
regression/nwoEBQuadCFITest does a convergence test on higher order coarse-fine interpolation
regression/ebFineInterpTest does a convergence test on coarse->fine interpolation (regridding or multigrid prolongation)
