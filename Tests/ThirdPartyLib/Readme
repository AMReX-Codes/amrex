This tests how AMReX can be used as a third-party library.  In this
simple example, the user's code is in main.c and it has no direct
interaction with AMReX.  It uses libfoo_cxx and libbar_f that in turn
use AMReX C++ and Fortran interfaces, respectively.

To build libamrex, follow the instruction at amrex/INSTALL.
