Examples written fully in Fortran90 (modifying the existing examples) with documentation to run the code in /doc using AMReX as third party lib.

Running is simple. Just execute the following scripts - has all the compile and run commands.

1. In Advection3d - sh run_Advection3d.sh
2. In Helmholtz_F - sh run_Helmholtz.sh
The details of the compiling and linking are in the pdfs in doc/

Makefile for compiling and linking generated automatically (using mkmf - no separate installation needed - just a perl script to auto generate makefile with dependency - will run out of the box - detailed explanation in /doc.)

1. Helmholtz problem in 3D with a given rhs - added documentation.
2. Advection problem in 3D in Fortran90 (Advection_F had a 2d example. Merged 3d routines from Advection_AmrCore - which was combination of cpp and F90).
