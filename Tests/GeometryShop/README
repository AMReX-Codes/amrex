ebgraphSingleGrid:makes a sphere on a single  box and sees if the graph makes any sense
ebgraphDistributed:makes a sphere on multiple boxes and sees if the graph makes any sense
sphere: does a test on sphere volume and boundary area to see if they are close to the exact answers.
sphereEBISBox: does a convergence test on sphere's moments (normals and boundary centroids).
flatPlate: makes a flat plate geometry and outputs its grpah.
sparseDataSingleGrid: checks to see that BaseIVFAB and BaseIFFAB copy do reasonable things.
sparseDataDistributied: Does the same thing for FabArray<BaseIVFAB> and FabArray<BaseIFFAB>
stencilTestBed: implements a stencil multiple ways and checks their timings.
regression/dataArith checks to see that the arithmetic functions of EBCellFAB and EBFaceFAB do the right things (right now just checking setval and +=).
regression/ebnormalizeTest checks the correctness of EBNormalizeByVolume fraction (kappa div f^c-> divF^nc)
regression/levelDivTest checks that redistribution is conservative.
regresson/fabio tests i/o for various FabArray<T>'s
regresson/ebio tests i/o for the EBIndexSpace singleton
regression/serialization tests serialization of several data holders
