Advection_AmrCore: 

This tutorial contains an AMR advection code 
that advects a single scalar field with a velocity field that is specified on faces.
It is written entirely in C++, can be built in 2D or 3D and run with the same
inputs file, and can be built with 

USE_MPI = TRUE
or 
USE_MPI = FALSE

and either 

USE_OMP = TRUE
or
USE_CUDA = TRUE

This example uses source code from the amrex/Src/Base, Boundary, and AmrCore directories.
To see a similar example that uses amrex/Src/Amr rather than AmrCore, see
the tutorial in amrex/Tutorials/Amr/Advection_AmrLevel.

If you run this code with plot_int > 0, 
plotfiles are generated that can be viewed with amrvis2d / amrvis3d
(CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool, downloadable separately from 
https://github.com/amrex-codes/amrvis) or with VisIt, yt or Paraview.
