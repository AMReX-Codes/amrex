Advection_AmrLevel: This test contains an AMR advection code that advects a
single scalar field with a velocity field that is specified on faces.

It is a C++ AMReX-based code designed to run in parallel using
MPI/OMP. Additionally, it can also be run using GPUs.

It uses source code from the amrex/Src/Base, Boundary, AmrCore, and
Amr directories.

The directories Exec/SingleVortex and Exec/UniformVelocity each include
a makefile and a sample inputs file.
Plotfiles are generated that can be viewed with amrvis2d / amrvis3d
(CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool, downloadable separately from ccse.lbl.gov)
or with VisIt.

Build Requirements
==================

Dimension:

  The Advection_AmrLevel tests only compile in 2 or 3 dimensions. Therefore
  when configuring CMake to build the test it maybe necessary to add the
  flag -DAMReX_SPACEDIM=2 or -DAMReX_SPACEDIM=3 (Enabled by default). If one
  sets -DAMReX_SPACEDIM=1, no executable will be created.

System:

  The Advection_AmrLevel tests are not supported on Windows systems.
