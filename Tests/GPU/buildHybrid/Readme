Simple, AMReX independent test to explore building a CUDA code
either as an executable or through a static library in the AMReX fashion.

This version is a hybrid C++ & Fortran build test.

Files
----- 
main.cpp contains the main which calls two C++ and one Fortran CUDA global functions.
MyKernel.cpp and MyKernelB.cpp contains the two CUDA global functions.
MyKernel_F.F90 contains a Fortran CUDA global function.

Make targets
------------
make: Build an executable directly using pgifortran. Used to test the code.

make exec: Build an executable through a static library using pgfortran. 
make library: Just build the static library using ar and ranlib.
