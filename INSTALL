There are three ways to use AMReX.

(1) Use AMReX's GNU Make build system.  There is no installation step
    in this approach.  Application codes are compiled together with
    AMReX codes.  Most of the examples in Tutorials can be built this
    way.  See `Tools/GNUMake/README.md` for more details.

(2) Build and install static library libamrex.a, AMReX headers and
    Fortran modules via `./configure` followed by `make` and `make
    install`.  Type `./configure -h` to show help message.  An
    application code uses its build system to compile and link to the
    AMReX library.  Because AMReX uses C++11 and Fortran, the linker
    needs to link the libraries.  See `OldTutorials/libamrex_C` for an
    example of this approach.  Note that this approach relies the make
    system in `Tools/GNUMake/`.  See `Tools/GNUMake/README.md` for
    more details on the make system.

(3) CMake.
