There are three ways to use AMReX.

(1) Use AMReX's GNU Make build system.  There is no installation step
    in this approach.  Application codes are compiled together with
    AMReX codes.  Most of the examples in Tutorials can be built this
    way.  See `Tools/GNUMake/README.md` for more details.

(2) Build and install static library libamrex.a, AMReX headers and
    Fortran modules via `./configure` followed by `make` and `make
    install`.  Type `./configure -h` to show help message.  An
    application code uses its build system to compile and link to the
    AMReX library.  Because AMReX uses C++14 and Fortran, the linker
    needs to link the libraries.  See
    `Tutorials/Basic/Build_with_libamrex` for an example of this
    approach.  Note that this approach relies the make system in
    `Tools/GNUMake/`.  See `Tools/GNUMake/README.md` for more details
    on the make system.

(3) CMake. See the "Building with CMake" page in the AMReX documentation
    page at the link below for more details.
