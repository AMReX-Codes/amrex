ppCleanup
=========

This python script is used to clean C Preprocessor macros and their
associated code from a source code file.  We'll refer to those macros
we wish to clean up as "cleanWords."

Example code removal:
---------------------

The basic bit of code you want to remove would be something like the
following, where the "X" is a line you should get rid of

#ifdef cleanWord      X
---code---            X
#endif                X

But there are more advanced/complex cases such as 

#ifdef cleanWord      X
---code---            X
#else                 X
---code---
#endif                X

#ifndef cleanWord     X
---code---
#else                 X
---code---            X
#endif                X

Or any such cases nested within others.  ppCleanup handles nesting by
recursively calling helper routines to handle specific cases.

Usage:
------

pCleanup.py [-h] [-c CLEANWORD_FILE] [--cw [CW [CW ...]]] [-o OUTPUT]
                    fileToClean

positional arguments:
  fileToClean           file to be cleaned

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show help message and exit
  -c CLEANWORD_FILE, --cleanword_file CLEANWORD_FILE
                        file containing the cleanWords; you must specify at
                        least one cleanWord on the command lineor in the
                        cleanWord file
  --cw [CW [CW ...]]    cleanup words specified on the command line;you must
                        specify at least one cleanWord on the command line or
                        in the cleanWord file
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        optionally specify the output file; default behaviour
                        is stdout


You can specify cleanWords via the command line (-cw) or in a
cleanWord file (-c).  You must specify at least one cleanWord either
from the command line or a cleanWord file.  A sample cleanWord file is
in ./cleanWords.txt

$ cat cleanWords.txt 
RADIATION
NEUTRINO
PARTICLES
SGS
LEVELSET

Example usage script:
---------------------

As a test, I converted all the Castro source code with the following script:

$ cat convert.sh
#!/bin/bash

ppCleanup=~/projects/ppCleanup/ppCleanup.py
cleanFile=~/projects/ppCleanup/cleanwords.txt

outDir=Castro_Strip

for file in `find Castro -name \* -print`; do
    oFile=$outDir/${file##Castro/}
    if [ -f $file ]; then
        python $ppCleanup -c $cleanFile $file -o $oFile
    else
        mkdir -p $oFile
    fi
done
