This directory contains code, useful for debugging, but which didn't
seem to belong anywhere else.

ArrayView.H               Allow access to ArrayView from within TotalView
DatasetClient.[H,cpp]

TV_TempWrite.H            Allows access to writeMF and readMF functions for
                            writing/reading MultiFab's into a file format
                            readable by the little functions in the ViewMF
                            subdirectory here

WritePlotFile.[H,cpp]     Define a function called writePlotFile which takes
                            a MultiFab and writes it into a HyperCLawV1.1 
                            pltfile format readable by pAmrvis

ViewMF                    Code for building a viewer for 2D and 3D which 
                            simply calls ArrayView after reading MultiFabs
                            written by writeMF defined in TV_TempWrite.H
                            The trivial code builds a simple viewer or a
                            viewer to the difference between two written
                            MultiFabs (useful for comparing output of two
                            separate codes).
