To use any of these modules in python, you need to set your PYTHONPATH
environment variable so that it knows where to find them:

export PYTHONPATH="/home/username/development/MAESTRO/fParallel/data_processing/python"

you can check this in python:

>> import sys
>> print sys.path

this should show the data_processing/python directory in python's search
path.

####
parseparticles.py
####
This module parses a particle file from MAESTRO when use_particles is
turned on.  This module should be imported in another script that
actually works with the data, e.g. plotting.  A sample of such a
script can be found in test_parseparticles.py


####
helmeos.py
####
This module builds a python wrapper around the fortran helmeos.f90
routine using f2py.  It also provides an eos() method similar to the
"subroutine eos" in eos_stuff.f90.  This module should be imported
into another script that actually wants to call the EOS.  Information
about the location of fParallel - either passed as an argumentn to the
helmeos.fwrap() method or through the environment variable FPARALLEL -
is needed to build the python wrapper using f2py.  An example of how
to use this module can be found in test_helmeos.py.
