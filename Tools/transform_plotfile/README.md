Tools for manipulating plotfiles

* `remove_level.py` : rewrite the Header of a plotfile, removing all
   reference to the fineset level.  This is useful for quickly making
   a smaller version of a plotfile that will work with visualization
   tools, to let you rapidly development visualization / analysis
   script on a small version of your data.
