"""
Search the Fortran source code for procedures marked with !$gpu in their specification part:

  subroutine sub(a)

    integer :: a

    !$gpu

    ...

  end subroutine sub

For each one, generate a device copy by prepending attributes(device) prior to the procedure statement:

  attributes(device) subroutine sub_device(a)

    integer :: a

    !$gpu

    ...

  end subroutine sub_device

Additionally, generate a host copy:

  subroutine sub_host(a)

    integer :: a

    !$gpu

    ...

  end subroutine sub_host

and then create a module interface for them:

  interface sub
    module procedure sub_host
