This is f90doc version 0.3.4, a documentation tool for Fortran 90.  For
more information (e.g., documentation), see

        http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~edemaine/f90doc

or contact Erik Demaine (edemaine@mit.edu).  Comments, suggestions,
criticisms, and bug reports go to this e-mail address.  If you modify f90doc or
use it in a serious way, please contact me (I'd be interested).

COPYRIGHT

f90doc is freeware.  If you use it in a research or commercial project, you
must acknowledge the software and its author.  I would also appreciate it if
you contact me -- I'd like to know how f90doc is used.  If you base code on
f90doc, you must acknowledge this.  Again, please let me know if you think your
changes would be at all useful to the rest of the world (even if you are not
willing to share it, the ideas may be useful).

This information must accompany any copy of f90doc.

INSTALLATION

You shouldn't have to compile anything.  You can put the file f90doc in
a more accessible place, but the .pl files have to be in the same directory.
Alternatively, you can create a symlink to the real f90doc, where the .pl
files are held.  For example,

        ln -s /usr/local/lib/f90doc-0.3.4/f90doc /usr/local/bin/f90doc

If you don't have a command /usr/bin/env, you'll need to replace the first line
of f90doc with

        #!/path/to/perl5/bin/perl -w

Otherwise, Perl version 5.003 or higher must be the first program called "perl"
in your path.
