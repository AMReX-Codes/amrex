AMReX Introduction
===================

AMReX is a publicly available software framework designed for
building massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) applications.

Key features of  include:

-   and Fortran interfaces

-  1-, 2- and 3-D support

-  Support for cell-centered, face-centered, edge-centered, and
   nodal data

-  Support for hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic solves on
   hierarchical adaptive grid structure

-  Optional subcycling in time for time-dependent PDEs

-  Support for particles

-  Parallelization via flat MPI, OpenMP, hybrid MPI/OpenMP, or MPI/MPI

-  Parallel I/O

-  Plotfile format supported by , , , and .

Because ’s core is mainly written in , the basics of is first introduced in  and then their Fortran wrappers if
available will be described as well.

Besides the User’s Guide, there is document generated by Doxygen at
