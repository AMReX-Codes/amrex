- cubical problem size -> rectahedral problem size ... init problem, restriction rules, etc...
- rectahedral problem size -> arbitrary problem shape...
- more efficient ghost zone exchange (box intersection algebra) when communicating edges and corners
- overlap BC with exchange
- add a VECTOR_INTERNAL
- iterate on F's (faster for 2nd order, slower for 4th order)?
