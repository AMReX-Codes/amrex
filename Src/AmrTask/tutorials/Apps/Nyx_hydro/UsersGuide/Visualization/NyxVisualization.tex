There are several visualization tools that can be used for Nyx
plotfiles.  The standard tool used within the
\amrex-community is \amrvis, a package developed and supported
by CCSE that is designed specifically for highly efficient visualization
of block-structured hierarchical AMR data.
Plotfiles can also be viewed using the \visit, \paraview, and \yt\ packages.
Particle data can be viewed using \paraview.

Please see Chapter 9 of the AMReX User's Guide (available in amrex/Docs)
for more detail about using all of these visualization packages. \\

\noindent To control which variables appear in the plotfile, the user can set \\

\noindent {\tt amr.plot\_vars} = \\
\noindent {\tt amr.derive\_plot\_vars} = \\

\noindent The default for {\tt amr.plot\_vars}
is all of the state variables.  The default for {\tt amr.derive\_plot\_vars} is none of
the derived variables.  So if you include neither of these lines then the plotfile
will contain all of the state variables and none of the derived variables. \\

\noindent If you want all of the state variables plus entropy and pressure (both derived quantities), for example, then set \\

\noindent {\tt amr.derive\_plot\_vars} = entropy pressure \\

\noindent If you just want density (state variable) and pressure (derived quantity), for example, then set \\

\noindent {\tt amr.plot\_vars} =  density \\

\noindent {\tt amr.derive\_plot\_vars} = pressure \\
