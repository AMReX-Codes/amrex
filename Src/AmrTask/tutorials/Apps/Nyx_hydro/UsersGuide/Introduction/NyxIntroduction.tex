\noindent Welcome to the NYX User's Guide!\\ \\

In this User's Guide we describe how to download and run Nyx, a massively parallel code
that couples the compressible hydrodynamic equations on a grid with a particle represenation
of dark matter. \\

Nyx uses an Eulerian grid for the hydrodynamics solver and incorporates adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).
