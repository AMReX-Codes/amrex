## Overview

AMReX is a software framework designed to accelerate scientific discovery for
applications solving partial differential equations on block-structured meshes. Its
massively parallel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) algorithms focus computational
resources and allow scalable performance on heterogeneous architectures so that
scientists can efficiently resolve details in large simulations.
AMReX is developed at [LBNL](https://www.lbl.gov/), [NREL](https://www.nrel.gov/),
and [ANL](https://www.anl.gov/) as part of the Block-Structured
AMR Co-Design Center in the Department of Energy's Exascale Computing Project.

More information is available at the [AMReX website](https://amrex-codes.github.io/).

## Features

- C++ and Fortran interfaces
- Support for cell-centered, face-centered, edge-centered, and nodal data
- Support for hyperbolic, parabolic, and elliptic solves on a hierarchical adaptive grid structure
- Optional subcycling in time for time-dependent PDEs
- Support for particles
- Embedded boundary description of irregular geometry
- Parallelization via flat MPI, OpenMP, hybrid MPI/OpenMP, or MPI/MPI
- GPU Acceleration with CUDA (NVidia), HIP (AMD) or SYCL (Intel) backends
- Parallel I/O
- Plotfile format supported by Amrvis, VisIt, ParaView and yt
- Built-in profiling tools

## Documentation

Four types of documentation are available:
- [User's Guide](https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/docs_html/) -- For more information about AMReX features and functions
- [Example Codes](https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/tutorials_html/#example-codes) -- The fastest way to start your own project
- [Guided Tutorials](https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/tutorials_html/GuidedTutorials.html) -- Learn basic AMReX topics in a progressive way
- [Technical Reference](https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/doxygen/) -- Conveniently searchable code documentation via Doxygen

## Gallery

AMReX supports several Exascale Computing Project software applications, such as
ExaSky, WarpX, Pele(Combustion), Astro, and MFiX-Exa. AMReX has also been used
in a wide variety of other scientific simulations, some of which, can be seen
in our application [gallery](https://amrex-codes.github.io/amrex/gallery.html).
