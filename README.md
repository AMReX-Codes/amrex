## Overview

**Warning: This is an alpha release of WarpX. The code is still in active development. Robustness and performance may fluctuate at this stage. The input and output formats may evolve.**

WarpX is an advanced electromagnetic Particle-In-Cell code.
It supports many features including Perfectly-Matched Layers (PML), mesh refinement, and the boosted-frame technique.
