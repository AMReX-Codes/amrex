To run in Python mode, do the following steps:

1. In the warpx directory, type:

   make -j4 USE_PYTHON_MAIN=TRUE

This should result in a library called libwarxp.so. 

2. Copy the library into the warpx/Exec/Langmuir/python directory.

This step can be streamlined in the future.

3. Run the Langmuir.py script in warpx/Exec/Langmuir/python, like so:

   python Langmuir.py inputs

This script initializes the simulation and runs it for 10 steps. It also
gets a numpy array of the particle positions and uses them to make a simple
plot using matplotlib.
